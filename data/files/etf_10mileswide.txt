Whoa, yeah

You say you're getting closer
To that chance of suicide
Tearing at your throat
You won't let it die
Left me here for all these days
And ripped apart my pride

Take my place and look inside 
I'm trying to find a place
To hide, hide
Lost my faith but don't you cry
I got a hole inside
And it's ten miles wide
(Yeah, alright)

Living on the coast
Cocktails and telling lies
Gotta fucking crush coming to life
You left me here for all these days
And ripped apart my pride

Take my place and look inside
I'm trying to find a place
To hide, hide
Lost my faith but don't you cry
I got a hole inside
And it's ten miles wide

It's not to late I'm close behind
I've gotta get inside your mind, mind
Lost my faith but don't you cry
I got a hole inside
And it's ten miles wide

(Wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide)

Take me on I'm feeling in the mood
For something dangerous
I've found myself again
Take me on I'm feeling in the mood
For something dangerous
I've found myself again

Take my place and look inside
I'm trying to find a place
To hide, hide
Lost my faith but don't you cry
I got a hole inside
And it's ten miles wide

Well I lost myself and looked inside
It branded me for life
I can't help myself it's mine to hide

I got a hole inside
It's feeling ten miles
It's feeling ten miles
It's feeling ten miles wide

Ten miles wide
Ten miles wide
Ten miles wide
