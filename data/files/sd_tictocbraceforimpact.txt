We drag ourselves like a chain behind a truck
And watch sparks coming up from under us
'Cause all we need is a little bang for our buck
Clock is ticking, tick, tick, tick, tick tock

And here we are, stumbling through the gate
Like a snake we're eating our own tail
We are the black leaves just released
We are the black leaves, don't you see it?

The clock ticks tick, tick tock, tick tock
The clock ticks, tick

Go and have another glass now
And drink it till you pass out
Time is almost up now
Buckle up, buckle up
Brace for impact!
Oh, it's a hard pill to swallow
When you're living in denial
Time is almost up now
Buckle up, buckle up
Brace for impact!

Oh, we just take, no we don't borrow
Fall asleep and expect a new tomorrow
Hit the gas and we don't stop
Clock is ticking, tick, tickeli-ticki-tick, tock

And here we are, stumbling through the gate
Like a snake we're eating our own tail
We are the black leaves just released
We are the black leaves, don't you see it?

The clock ticks, tick, tick tock, tick tock
The clock ticks, tick

Go and have another glass now
And drink it till you pass out
Time is almost up now
Buckle up, buckle up
Brace for impact!
Oh, it's a hard pill to swallow
When you're living in denial
Time is almost up now
Buckle up, buckle up
Brace for impact!

Brace for impact!
Yeah!
Brace for impact!

Tictoc, get the fuck out of the way
Tictoc, it's gonna burn
The clock ticks, tick, tock

Go and have another glass now
And drink it till you pass out
Time is almost up now
Buckle up, buckle up
Brace for impact!
Oh, it's a hard pill to swallow
When you're living in denial
Time is almost up now
Buckle up, buckle up
Brace for impact!

Whooah, we're at the end of this sick show
Buckle up, buckle up
Brace for impact!
(Whooah) oh, it's a hard pill to swallow
When you're living in denial (whooah)
Time is almost up now
Buckle up, buckle up
Brace for impact!
