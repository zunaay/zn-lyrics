Got sucker-punched by all you chumps
Don't give a fuck, I'll just get up
You better run 'cause I've brought all of my goons
Little man, know that I am out for you
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Get out my face, I'm a shooting star
Spend my nights in front of crowds
Then I rage on stage 'til my voice goes out

Tore up from the floor up, call me batshit crazy
Tore up from the floor up, call me out

I'll smoke you out
I'll burn your house down to the ground
You won't make a sound, when you're six feet underground
You better run, I'm a loaded gun, painting a target on everyone
You won't make a sound, when you're six feet underground

I'll make that smile turn upside down
Eat my twelves, you fucking clown
End your life with a click-clack-boom
And hide your body somewhere it will not be found
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Get out my face, I'm a shooting star
Spend my nights in front of crowds
Then I rage on stage 'til my voice goes out

Tore up from the floor up, call me batshit crazy
Tore up from the floor up, call me out

I'll smoke you out
I'll burn your house down to the ground
You won't make a sound, when you're six feet underground
You better run, I'm a loaded gun, painting a target on everyone
You won't make a sound, when you're six feet underground

Better watch out!
Uh

Watch out, the ground comes fast, I don't get mad, I just get even
Watch out, the ground comes fast, I don't look back, I just get even
Watch out, the ground comes fast, I don't get mad, I just get even
Watch out, the ground comes fast, I don't look back, I just get even

Tore up from the floor up, call me batshit crazy
Tore up from the floor up, call me out

I'll smoke you out
I'll burn your house down to the ground
You won't make a sound, when you're six feet underground
You better run, I'm a loaded gun, painting a target on everyone
You won't make a sound, when you're six feet underground
