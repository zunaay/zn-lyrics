Take my heart
When you are drowning
I go so far
To keep you smiling

Fighting
Yeah, it never fixed anything
Hiding
No, it never cured suffering
I'll hold you
When is burn us both alive

And they tell me that you're not worth fighting for
I've been to hell and back for you
Whatever you do, I still stay yours
I'll go back through hell for you

Pain relief
New lows to sink to
It's draining me
But that I'll give you

And I promise I'll be holding you
When it burns us both alive

And they tell me that you're not worth fighting for
I've been to hell and back for you
Whatever you do I still stay yours
I'll go back through hell for you
(I'll go back through hell for you)
I'll go back through hell for you

For you, I'll fight
Even if it ruins my life
Don't you know I've been to hell and back for you

For you, I'll try
When nobody else will
I'll go back through hell for you

And they tell me that you're not worth fighting for
I've been to hell and back for you
Whatever you do, I still stay yours
I'll go back through hell for you

And they tell me that you're not worth dying for
I've been to hell and back for you
Whatever you do I still endure
I'll go back through hell for you

Don't you know I've been to hell and back for you
I'll go back through hell for you
