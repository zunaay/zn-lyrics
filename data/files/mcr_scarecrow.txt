Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide

Make a wish when your childhood dies
Hear the knock, knock, knock when she cries
We're all alone tonight

Hold your breath when a black bird flies
Count to seventeen and close your eyes
I'll keep you safe inside

Heat burns my skin
Never mattered 'bout the shape I'm in
I'll keep you safe tonight, y-yeah

Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide

Blow a kiss at the methane skies
See the walls through your playground eyes
We're all in love tonight (all in love tonight)

Leave the train where the fallout lies
Watch it grow with the tear-stained
Just to keep you safe tonight

Heat burns my skin
Never mattered 'bout the shape I'm in
I'll keep you safe tonight, y-yeah

Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide

Love, love
Love won't stop this bomb, bomb
Love won't stop this bomb, bomb
Love won't stop this bomb

Run, run, bunny run
Run, run, bunny run

Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide

Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
