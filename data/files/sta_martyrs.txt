I picture myself sometimes
Alone in the crowd
I open my mouth to speak
But nothing comes out

All the times that I told myself that everything's fine
They don't add up to all the times
I swallowed my pride
My pride is gone

I'll run away from my past today
Slowing my memory
I'm making my way away from you
And all the martyrs they go away
All this from yesterday
I'm making my way away from you

All the times that I held my tongue
So you'd feel fine
It all comes back to haunt the one
That poisons inside

And I feel a strange fear sometimes
Pulling me in
It's a long walk to the top
But I've never been
I've never been there

I'll run away from my past today
Slowing my memory
I'm making my way away from you
And all the martyrs they go away
All this from yesterday
I'm making my way away from you

I open my mouth to scream
But nothing comes out

I'll run away from my past today
Slowing my memory
I'm making my way away from you
And all the martyrs they go away
All this from yesterday
I'm making my way away from you

From you
From you
From you
