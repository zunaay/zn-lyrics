I never thought you'd leave me alone
Facing my demons on my own
I never thought that you would've left
Setting a weight down on my chest

Need some time to clear my mind

I may never be free
Trying to find some peace within me
This life's all that I get
Nothing changes, I'll bite the bullet

I never thought I'd be such a mess
Living each day in such distress
I never thought I'd go on like this
For you, I'll move on at my best

Need some time to clear my mind

I may never be free
Trying to find some peace within me
This life's all that I get
Nothing changes, I'll bite the bullet

Cracks are starting to show
Now you're gone, it's all that I know
I'll move on, remember you told me I could
Face the world and bite the bullet

I may never be free
Trying to find some peace within me
This life's all that I get
Nothing changes, I'll bite the bullet

Bite the bullet
