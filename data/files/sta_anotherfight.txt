Many times I've taken
The wrong road by mistake and many times
I meant to get lost
And every bad decision
Lost in every admonition
Was a way to burn
A bridge that I crossed

It's not too late to start again

Alright, hold tight
I'm never gonna lose another fight
In time, you'll find
There's nothing you can say
To change my mind
I don't feel bad, now I know that
There's a new life waiting for me
Alright, hold tight
I'm never gonna lose another fight

Many nights I waken
To a city that's forsaken
Many nights I've tried to sleep through
But when we face the darkness
A light goes on inside us
And somehow we know
Just what to do

It's not too late to start again

Alright, hold tight
I'm never gonna lose another fight
In time, you'll find
There's nothing you can say
To change my mind
I don't feel bad, now I know that
There's a new life waiting for me
Alright, hold tight
I'm never gonna lose another fight

You're never safe, you're never sound
Will you help me, will you throw me to the ground
I am done letting pain push me around
I'm getting up, you're going down

Alright, hold tight
I'm never gonna lose another fight
In time, you'll find
There's nothing you can say
To change my mind
I don't feel bad, now I know that
There's a new life waiting for me
Alright, hold tight
I'm never gonna lose another fight
I'm never gonna lose another fight
