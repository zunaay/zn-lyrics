I'm sick of burying all my feelings (in isolation)
I'm done with absorbing all the beatings (where's the salvation?)

We've been drowning for far too long

It's time to take a stand and save our lives
Rise before we fall
There's no more second chance, it's do or die
Rise above it all

I've felt the wearying sense of failure (corroboration)
I've traded everything with a traitor (dissociation)

It's time to take a stand and save our lives
Rise before we fall
There's no more second chance, it's do or die
Rise above it all

It's time to take a stand and save our lives
Rise before we fall
There's no more second chance, it's do or die
Rise above it all

It's time to take a stand and save our lives
Save our souls
There's no more second chance, it's do or die
Rise above it all

It's time to take a stand and save our lives
Rise before we fall
There's no more second chance, it's do or die
Rise above it all
