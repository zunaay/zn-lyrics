Good morning day
Sorry I'm not there
But all my favourite friends
Vanished in the air
It's hard to fly when you can't even run
Once I had the world, but now I've got no one

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I drownâ€¦.drown

Good morning day
Sorry you're not here
All those times before
We're never this unclear
It's hard to walk when you can't even crawl
Once I had this world, but now I've lost it all

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I drown

Rolling faster than I'm breathing
Drown
Rolling faster than I'm breathing
Drown
Rolling faster than I'm breathing

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I

(Save myself before I drown)
(Save myself before I drown)
(Save myself before I drown)
