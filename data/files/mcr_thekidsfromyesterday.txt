Well, now this could be the last of all the rides we take
So hold on tight and don't look back
We don't care about the message or the rules they make
I'll find you when the sun goes black

And you only live forever in the lights you make
When we were young we used to say
That you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
Now we are the kids from yesterday

All the cameras watch the accidents and the stars you hate
They only care if you can bleed
Does the television make you feel the pills you ate
Or every person that you need to be

'Cause you only live forever in the lights you make
When we were young we used to say
That you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
Now we are the kids from yesterday

Today, today
We are the kids from yesterday
Today, today

Today (here we are and we won't stop breathing)
Today (yell it out 'till your heart stop beating)

We are the kids from yesterday, today

'Cause you only live forever in the lights you make
When we were young we used to say
That you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
Now we are the kids from yesterday

We are the kids from yesterday
We are the kids from yesterday
We are the kids from yesterday

Today, today
