Why do we do these terrible things we do
Pretending there's a cloud of fog we can't see through
And I know I've said some things
I'll always regret
You're the only one I know who sees
Through all that

Someday, someway
If we could find the words to say
There'd be no more fighting
No taking sides
And up on the shelf above us
Our ideas turn to rust
And the things we love they lose their shine
It's a flawed design

I will never say I'll do something I won't do
'Cause I can't live with myself if I don't pull through
Right here's the only place that I wanna be with you

Someday, someway
If we could find the words to say
There'd be no more fighting
No taking sides
And up on the shelf above us
Our ideas turn to rust
And the things we love they lose their shine
Oh it's a flawed design

Get away, get away, get away if you can
'Cause this is the world I'm fighting for

There'd be no more fighting
No taking sides

Someday, someway
If we could find the words to say
There'd be no more fighting
No taking sides
And up on the shelf above us
Our ideas turn to rust
And the things we love they lose their shine
Oh it's a flawed design
Oh it's a flawed design
