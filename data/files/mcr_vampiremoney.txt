Well, are you ready, Ray? (Yeah)
How about you, Frank? (Oh I'm there, baby)
How about you, Mikey? (Fucking ready)
Well, I think I'm alright
One, two, three, four!

Three, two, one, we came to fuck
Everybody party 'till the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the morning Sun
And get a parking violation on La Brea 'till it's done

Hair Back, collar up, jet black, so cool!
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you

(Come on) When you wanna be a movie star
(Come on) Play the game and take band real far
(Come on) Play it right and drive a Volvo car
(Come on) Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're alright honey
Pills don't help but it sure it's funny
Gimmie gimmie some of that vampire money
Come on!

Oh, you look like somebody I used to love

Three, two, one, we got the bomb
Everybody hurry till the tax man comes
Glimmer like Bolan in the morning Sun
And get your finger on the trigger
Tap the barrel of the a gun

Hair back, motherfucker!
Jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you

(Come on) When you wanna be a movie star
(Come on) Play the game and take band real far
(Come on) Play it right and drive a Volvo car
(Come on) Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're alright honey
Pills don't help but it sure it's funny
Gimmie gimmie some of that vampire money
Come on!

Ah, fuck yeah
That's right
One, two, three, four!

Well, three, two, one, we came to fuck
Everybody party till the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the morning Sun
And get a parking violation on La Brea 'till it's done

Hair Back, collar up, jet black, so cool!
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you

(Come on) When you wanna be a movie star
(Come on) Play the game and take band real far
(Come on) Play it right and drive a Volvo car
(Come on) Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're alright, honey
Pills don't help, but it sure is funny
Give me, give me some of that vampire money
Come on

Well, I sure like the way (come on)
Sure like the way you're looking at me (come on)
Well, I sure like the way you're looking at me right there (come on)
Well, I sure like the way you're looking at me (come on)
There (on), there (on), there (on)

Oh wait, oh, I'm such an idiot, the music is way too loud
You're gonna have to turn it down a little, sorry
