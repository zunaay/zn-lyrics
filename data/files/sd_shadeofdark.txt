I have never been so hollow
Went to hell and back, so follow me

As I go into the shadow (shadow, shadow, shadow)
It's time for me to get off my knees
That rotten mind, just set it free from all this tragedy

There's something wrong inside of me
Keeps me awake, that darker kind of shade
Am I going down?
Am I going down?
It keeps me awake, that darker kind of state
Am I going down?
Am I going down?

I just lost another battle
Know that miracles don't happen here
So, I look straight down the barrel (barrel, barrel, barrel)

It's time for me to get off my knees
That rotten mind, just set it free from all this tragedy
There's something wrong inside of me

It keeps me awake, that darker kind of shade
Am I going down?
Am I going down?
It keeps me awake, that darker kind of state
Am I going down?
Am I going down?

You're gonna miss it when you fall apart
I swear I never really gave you my heart
You're gonna miss it when you fall apart
And disappear, it all ends here
(It keeps me awake)

It keeps me awake, that darker kind of shade
Am I going down?
Am I going down?
It keeps me awake, that darker kind of state
Am I going down?
Am I going down?
