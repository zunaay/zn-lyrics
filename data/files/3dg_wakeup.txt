I'm not sober all the time
You bring me down at least you try
Until we see this eye to eye
I don't want you

I must be running out of luck
'Cause you're just not drunk enough to fuck
And now I've had it up to here
I don't, I don't want you

It took so long to see
You walked away from me
When I need you

Wake up I'm pounding on the door
I'm not the man I was before
Where the hell are you
When I need you

Wake up I'm pounding on the door
I won't hurt you anymore
Where the hell are you
When I need you

I'm not angry all the time
You push me down at least you try
Until we see this eye to eye
I don't want you

It took so long to see
You walked away from me
When I need you

Wake up I'm pounding on the door
I'm not the man I was before
Where the hell are you
When I need you

Wake up I'm pounding on the door
I won't hurt you anymore
Where the hell are you
When I need you

It took so long to see
You walked away from me
When I need you

Wake up I'm pounding on the door
I'm not the man I was before
Where the hell are you
When I need you

Wake up I'm pounding on the door
I won't hurt you anymore
Where the hell are you
When I need you
