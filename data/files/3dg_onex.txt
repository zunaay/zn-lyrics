Do you think about
Everything you've been through
You never thought you'd be so depressed
Are you wondering
Is it life or death
Do you think that there's no one like you

We are
We are
We are

We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one
We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one

The life I think about
Is so much better than this
I never thought I'd be stuck in this mess
I'm sick of wondering
Is it life or death?
I need to figure out who's behind you

We are
We are
We are

We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one
We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one

The life I think about
Is so much better than this
I never thought I'd be stuck in this mess
I'm sick of wondering
Is it life or death?

We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one
We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one

We stand above the crowd
We stand above the crowd
We stand above the crowd (crowd)
(We stand) we stand above the crowd
We stand above the crowd (we stand)
We stand above the crowd

(We are the ones) we stand above the crowd
(We get knocked down get back up)
We stand above the crowd
(We are the ones) we stand above the crowd
(We get knocked down get back up)
We stand above the crowd

We stand above the crowd
We stand above the crowd
We stand above the crowd
