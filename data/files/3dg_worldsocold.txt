I never thought I'd feel this
Guilty and I'm broken down inside
Livin' with myself
Nothing but lies

I always thought I'd make it
But never knew I'd let it get so bad
Livin' with myself
Is all I have

I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like I'm frozen in time

Livin' in a world so cold
Wasting away
Livin' in a shell with no soul
Since you've gone away
Livin' in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away

Do you ever feel me
Do you ever look deep down inside
Starin' at yourself
Paralyzed

I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like I'm frozen in time

Livin' in a world so cold
Wasting away
Livin' in a shell with no soul
Since you've gone away
Livin' in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away from me

I'm too young to lose my soul
I'm too young to feel this old
For so long I'm left behind
I feel like I'm losing my mind

Do you ever feel me
Do you ever look deep down inside
Starin' at your life
Paralyzed

Livin' in a world so cold
Wasting away
Livin' in a shell with no soul
Since you've gone away
Livin' in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away from me

I'm too young
I'm too young
