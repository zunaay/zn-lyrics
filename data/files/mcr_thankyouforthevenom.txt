Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal
And you never had a chance
Love it, or leave it, you can't understand
A pretty face, but you do so carry on
And on
And on

I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me
I'm just the way that the doctor made me, on
And on
And on
And on
Love is the red of the rose on your coffin door
What's life like, bleeding on the floor
The floor
The floor

You'll never make me leave
I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe

So give me all your poison
And give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts
To make me ill
You're running after something
That you'll never kill
If this is what you want
Then fire at will

Preach all you want but who's gonna save me?
I keep a gun on the book you gave me, hallelujah, lock and load
Black is the kiss, the touch of the serpent sun
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one
And one
And one
And one

You'll never make me leave
I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe

So give me all your poison
And give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts
To make me ill
You're running after something
That you'll never kill
If this is what you want
Then fire at will

You'll never make me leave
I wear this on my sleeve
You wanna follow something
Give me a better cause to lead
Just give me what I need
Give me a reason to believe

So give me all your poison
And give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts
To make me ill
You're running after something
That you'll never kill
If this is what you want
Then fire at will

So give me all your poison
And give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts
To make me ill
You're running after something
That you'll never kill
If this is what you want
Then fire at will
