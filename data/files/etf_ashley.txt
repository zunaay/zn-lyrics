Shadows fall on yesterday
It's like time just slips away
I'm nothing, when darkness follows me
The dawn, it never shows its head
I'm left dying here instead with nothing
A lock without a key

Like the brightest star you shine through

Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive
I've got purpose once again, yeah, yeah
Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive
I've got purpose once again, yeah, yeah

(I've got purpose once again)

If looks could kill you'd be the one
That takes my world and makes me numb
I'm nothing, without you I can't breathe
(I can't breathe)
And as the sunlight burns the sky
I see through my obsessive eyes
I'm nothing, without you I can't see

Like the brightest star you shine through

Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive
I've got purpose once again, yeah, yeah
Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive
I've got purpose once again, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

You're the strength I need to fight
You're the reason I still try
I'm the not and you're the might
Use these wings so I can fly
I can fly

Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive
I've got purpose once again, yeah, yeah

Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive
I've got purpose once again, yeah, yeah
Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive
I've got purpose once again, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I've got purpose once again
I've got purpose once again
