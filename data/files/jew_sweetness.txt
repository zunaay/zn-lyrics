Are you listening (whoa,oh,oh,oh,oh)
Sing it back (whoa,oh,oh,oh,oh)

String from your tether unwinds
(String from your tether unwinds, whoa oh, whoa oh)
Up and outward to bind
(Up and outward to bind, whoa oh, whoa oh)

I was spinning free (whoa,oh,oh,oh,oh)
With a little sweet and simple numbing me

Are you listening? (whoa,oh,oh,oh,oh)
Sing it back (whoa,oh,oh,oh,oh)

So tell me what do I need 
(Tell me what do I need, whoa oh, whoa oh)
When words lose their meaning
(When words lose their meaning, whoa oh, whoa oh)

I was spinning free (whoa,oh,oh,oh,oh)
With a little sweet and simple numbing me
Yeah, stumble 'til you crawl (whoa,oh,oh,oh,oh)
Sinking into sweet uncertainty

(Are you listening? Are you listening?)

If you're listening (whoa,oh,oh,oh,oh)
(If you're listening, are you listening?)
Sing it back (Whoa,oh,oh,oh,oh)
(If you're listening, are you listening?)

I'm still running away (I'm still running away)
Whoa oh (whoa oh), whoa oh (whoa oh)
I won't play your hide and seek game
(Your hide and seek game)
Whoa oh (whoa oh), whoa oh

I was spinning free (whoa,oh,oh,oh,oh)
With a little sweet and simple numbing me
What a dizzy dance (whoa,oh,oh,oh,oh)
This sweetness will not be concerned with me

No, the sweetness will not be concerned with me
No, the sweetness will not be concerned with me
