And we're at it again
I turn around another fucking war, man
I don't know where to begin
But I'll start with the radical leaders
Their steps we're followin'

Running
Don't go back and fight
Too many you'll lose
(And as clowns you follow suit
Behind the blood between the red and white and blue
But it's too deep for you to see
And everyone eventually will take the step cause
It's in sight you take the left
I'll take the right I fell the hate
You've built for me and I say pay attention baby)

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease

But it wasn't a sin
A sorry lie in judging every action
And as they're filling your mind with this shit
You forget how to speak and ask all the questions

Business is at hand tonight
Make the people choose
(I see another side in you
But there's not much more I can do from on the outside
Looking in your government is listenin'
To push you on the story of immortal father
Mortal son give them your mind
And all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)

If I had it their way I'd burn in Hell
And your future's a fuckin' disaster can't you see
Don't give them all the power
When your future's in desperate trouble baby

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease

I'd run away tonight
With my mind still intact I'm gonna make it alright
Easier said than done
With no place to hide and having no place to

Running away from condition
I see you but you're running away from
Your scared seducive system

Most would claim I live a lie (I live a lie)
When pointing out it's easy to predict these things (predict these things)
Every color has its side (I have a side)
They live together, vote and most embrace the same dark times
Please help us, please save us
Of course they have control we're all the same

Up on the cross
Crucified their problem drove the nail and let Him rot

Family and friends
It won't matter in the end I'm sure they'll understand

Now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder 'bout
How you sold your mind body and soul
Looking at the fields so green
I know this sounds obscene
I see you're livin' for tomorrow
But decisions you have made will leave you empty

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease

I'd run away tonight
With my mind still intact I'm gonna make it alright
Easier said than done
With no place to hide and having no place to
Run!

You've fallen asleep in denial
Look at the way we're dyin' one by one
How it ends I'll never know
Just live your life blind like me
