Alright children,
The lights are out and the party is over
It's time for me Dr. D to start running and say good bye, for a little while.
And I know you're gonna miss me. So I'll leave you with this:
You know that big ball of radiation we call the sun?
It'll burst you into flames if you stay in one place to long.
That's if the static don't get you first
So remember even if you're dusted you may be gone.
But out here in the desert. Your shadow lives on without you
This is Doctor Deathdefying. Signing off.
