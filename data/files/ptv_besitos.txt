You're my favorite explosion

A violin with no hands plays symphonies with no words
A drowning boy with no voice prays someone up there's telling me
You'd better not get back up!
I spit my heart into this red cup
I'd better pick it back up, it might ruin your night

And she said: Baby, leave the water by the bed for later
I woke up without a single drop
I told myself I'm tired of holding up your backup plans
Go down your list and be satisfied, if all you have is not enough

(True love comes from more than just the heart)

She said, paint a picture of me
Throw your dress up and your heart away
Yeah I heard what you said
A friend of a friend these strangers at the party never paid
And if that doesn't turn you on
I'll keep talking till something does
And as we're covered in sand you roll over and smile

I told myself I'm tired of holding up your backup plans
Go down your list and be satisfied, it's all you have
And until that day (that day)
I'll steal your flowers from the cemetery, red roses
Red rose of the dead
How does it feel to breathe oxygen inside her head?

So say it (say it, say it, say-)
I'm in love, cause you called me
Cryin' (cryin', criyin', cry-) 
From your job, said you just got fired
And you don't have a backup plan
So don't expect me to understand

(A diamond bullet and a gun made of gold)
(She was covered in blood, last seen in San Francisco)

Yeah! Alright!
We all breakdown
Sometimes these bedroom walls become my only friend
But, they were there from beginning to end

I'm tired of holding up your backup plans
Go down your list and be satisfied it's all you have
You know I've never held a gun in my life
But now I carry one around in case I see you tonight

Bedroom walls
Oh, these bedroom walls
Oh, I hate what it tastes like
