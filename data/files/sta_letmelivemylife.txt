I am scared of the face in the mirror
All the cracks in the glass, getting clearer
I always overthink make it so hard
On no one else but myself

Let me live my life
I can go get my knife
Or I can pull out the one that you stuck in my back
For my suffering, you've got nothing to gain
My pain is your entertainment

I feel the fear in my head, it's so heavy
Holding down both my hands to keep them steady
When I stop shaking, everything's so easy
On myself, no one else

Let me live my life
I can go get my knife
Or I can pull out the one that you stuck in my back
For my suffering, you've got nothing to gain
My pain is your entertainment

Let me live my life
I can go get my knife
Or I can pull out the one that you stuck in my back
For my suffering, you've got nothing to gain
My pain is your entertainment

Let me live my life
I can go get my knife
Or I can pull out the one that you stuck in my back
For my suffering, you've got nothing to gain
My pain is your entertainment

Let me live my life and pull out the knife
You know, the one that you stuck in my back
The one that you stuck in my back
