I try my hardest
Not to fall apart
I get the furthest
When my mind is dark

I see the clearest
When I'm in the blind
I long for some place else
Is it over? Is it over?

Alone is the way that I feel like home
Insecurety's in my bones
And down the hole I climb
Let it bury me
Let it bury me Alive

And the hardest thing of my past
Is that no one knows I'm a mess
And down the hole I climb
Let it bury me alive

Sometimes I feel alive
Sometimes I'd rather die
Sometimes It's all at once
Sometimes I'm fucking done

Alone is the way that I feel like home
Insecurety's in my bones
And down the hole I climb
Let it bury me
Let it bury me alive

And the hardest thing of my past
Is that no one knows I'm a mess
And down the hole I climb
Let it bury me alive

I see the clearest
When I'm in the blind
I search for something
I Will never find

Sometimes It's emptiness
Sometimes I'm full of It
Fast forward and rewind
I do it all the times

Alone is the way that I feel like home
Insecurety's in my bones
And down the hole I climb
Let it bury me
Let it bury me alive

And the hardest thing of my past
Is that no one knows I'm a mess
And down the hole I climb
Let it bury me
Let it bury me alive
