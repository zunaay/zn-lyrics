How can we move ahead when time is frozen?
How long before we see we're all so broken?

I can feel the walls are closing in on me
And I can see the dark cloud coming over me
I can't breathe, it's like they're suffocating me
If I give in, will it be the end of me?

How can we move ahead when time is frozen?
How long before we see we're all so broken?
I won't let go, trappеd in a world this cold
How can I break the mold?

I can't move
It's likе they've tied their weights to me
I can't swim
Will this be the end of me?

How can we move ahead when time is frozen?
How long before we see we're all so broken?
I won't let go, trapped in a world this cold
How can I break the mold?

I'll never fit the standard
I can't be bought or sold
No longer righteous anger
I'll never lose control
I'll never stand in their lines
Watching it all unfold
You won't control what is mine
How can I break the mold?

How can we move ahead when time is frozen?
How long before we see we're all so broken?

How can we move ahead when time is frozen? (Time is frozen)
How long before we see we're all so broken? (We're all broken)
I won't let go, trapped in a world this cold
How can I break the mold?
