I can't wait to see your brilliant face
Light up the room around the pillowcase
She said: Can you come over to my LA place
I got something to tell you and it just can't wait
When I showed up you held the door in tears
Sat on the couch under the chandeliers
You said you're having a baby and before I could cry
You're leaving me just when I thought you were mine

But I don't see your face
Taken by the one hearted race home now
But don't tell your other man
I got a hell of a plan

Failing lights amass one hundred sleepless nights
And I might be holding on too tight
But there is a beast in my heart
And he won't let you leave alive

Nightmares
No longer wait for sleep
Crawl on the ground on both your hands and knees
Just like a, lion and you're the queen of the pride
And we will feast together till the bones are dry

But I don't see your face
Taken by the one hearted race home now
But don't tell your other man
He's not a part of the plan

Failing lights amass one hundred sleepless nights
And I might be holding on too tight
But there is a beast in my heart
And he won't let you leave alive

Do you still love me? I am dying to know
Or did you forget what we shared?
Out of sight out of mind I was never even there

Failing lights, amass one hundred sleepless nights
And I might be holding on too tight
But there is a beast in my heart
And he won't let you leave alive

This is the price you'll pay
Thoughts in your head that will never die

So don't you forget what we had
It's like I was never even there

Go!
