Well, when you go
Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way

Well, after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out while you can

When you go, would you even turn to say
I don't love you like I did yesterday?

Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby when they knock you
Down and out is where you ought to stay

Well, after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up while you can
Whoa, whoa

When you go would you even turn to say
I don't love you like I did yesterday

Well, come on, come on

When you go, would you have the guts to say
I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday

I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday

I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday
