We are the children you reject and disregard
These aching cries come from the bottom of our hearts
You can't disown us now, we are your own flesh and blood
We don't disappear just because your eyes are shut

Now tell me

Love loss like a bullets path
Tear through the cavity of my chest
Lights out because the fuse has blown

As their castles crumble slowly
We watch them fall
The crown slips from heads unworthy
As we gain control

This is the family that we crossed or never had
This is a war that was lost the day that it began
Because it's the race we run, but it keeps us at the start
It's the song I sung from the bottom of my heart

That's how we

Read you like a polygraph
Not one single bone in your back
Own up to how you let us down

As their castles crumble slowly
We watch them fall
The crown slips from heads unworthy
As we gain control

Except for you and me, love
Everyone is the same
We know, we know, we know, we know
But if to live, we have to be numb
I'd rather know the pain
I'd rather know, I'd rather know
This happens almost never
But it happened once to me
And this will never be same
The ends we seam together

I'm not after fame and fortune
I'm after you
When I've served my time I swear
I will come back for you

As their castles crumble slowly
We watch them fall
The crown slips from heads unworthy
Right on to ours, but I'm after you?

I'm after you
I'm after you
I'm after you
