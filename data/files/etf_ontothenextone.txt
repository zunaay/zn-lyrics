This love is bittersweet
It's always incomplete
Right now you're killing me (ohhh-oh)
'Cause everything that you say
And every time that you stay
I see that now you have changed
And I'm the one that you blame

Now you're gone
And you're on to the next one

This time I've got to live without you
That's just the way it has to be
This time I've got to live without you (Wa-ah-oh)
And you're on to the next one

When this night, turns to day
I know that people change
But you just stay the same
You would swear, on your grave
That you would never become
Exactly what you hate

Now you're gone
And you're onto the next one

This time I've got to live without you
That's just the way it has to be
This time I've got to live without you (Wa-ah-oh)
And you're on to the next one
On to the next one

Every night turns to day
And every one has to change

Now you're gone
And you're on to the next one

This time I've got to live without you
That's just the way it has to be
This time I've got to live without you (Wa-ah-oh)
And you're on to the next one

This time I've got to live without you
That's just the way it has to be
This time I've got to live without you (Wa-ah-oh)
And you're on to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
