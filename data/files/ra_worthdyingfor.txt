Set me off like dynamite
Strapped tight around my waist
We are the ones in competition
But claim this ain't no race

(Let's go!)

Take a breath and explode like bullets
Tearing through the wind
Cut me up with a razor blade
Then try to separate the skin

Now when the
White flames are burning flags
We found a world worth dying for yeah
We've been battered so hard that
We don't feel anymore

Take me from this world, save me
What if we all die young?
So take me from this world, save me
What if we all die young?

Send me off on the morning breeze
So far away from here
Fill your eyes in the strains of thought
Outside the warm embracing air
I'm moving slow 
Like a glacier melting
Watch me dissipate
I searched for love in an empty world
But all I found was hate

Now when the 
White flames are burning flags
We found a world worth dying for, yeah
We've been battered so hard that
We don't feel anymore

Take me from this world, save me
What if we all die young?
So take me from this world, save me
What if we all die young?

Don't ask me why 'cuz I don't know
Don't ask me how I'm gonna solve this on my own
Don't ask me why 'cuz I don't know
These things I'll never face
Scratch out, but won't erase

In the wreckage of a job well done
I saw a place I'd never seen before, yeah
And that moment I refused to close my eyes anymore

Take me from this world, save me
What if we all die young?
So take me from this world, save me
What if we all die young?

So take me
So take me
