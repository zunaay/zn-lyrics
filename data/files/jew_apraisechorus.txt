Are you going to live your life wondering
Standing in the back looking around?
Are you gonna waste your time thinking
How you've grown up or how you missed out?

Things are never going be the way you want
Where's it gonna to get you acting serious?
Things are never gonna be quite what you want
Even at twenty five you got to start sometime

I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
All I need is just to hear a song I know
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight

Are you gonna live your life
Standing in the back looking around?
Are you going to waste your time?
Got to make a move or you'll miss out

Someone's gonna ask you what it's all about
Stick around nostalgia won't let you down
Someone's gonna ask you what it's all about
What are you going to have to say for yourself?

I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
All I need is just to hear a song I know
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight

Crimson and clover
Over and over
Crimson and clover
Over and over

Our house, in the middle of the street
Why did we ever meet
Start in by rockin my fantasy

Don't don't don't let start
Why did we ever part
Kickstart my rock n roll heart

I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
So come on davey, sing me something that I know
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
I want to fall in love tonight (here, tonight)

I want to fall in love tonight (here, tonight)
I want to always feel like part of this was mine

I want to fall in love tonight
I want to fall in love tonight
I want to fall in love tonight
