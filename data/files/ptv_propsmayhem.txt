Self medicated, while they sleep
We let the night chase
Evil things away
And we're like animals homesick from shows
We've got to kill everything before the night gets wasted

Maybe it's seem so strange
But we don't even stress at all
'Cause we've got poisons in our well
(Poisons in our well)

Come at me with everything you've got.

Burst into flames, scream in the dark
I'm gonna light up this place
And die in beautiful stars tonight

Does it even make a difference?
When I'm sober, I feel pain
'Cause we run under the stars through cemetery backyards
Celebrate the way the night hides scars

So dance!
If it moves you
Jump in the fire
If it burns you
I'll throw my arms around you darling
And we'll turn to ashes drowning in the flame

Burst into flames, scream in the dark!
I'm gonna light up this place and die in beautiful stars!

What if these demons keep falling from the sky?
Sometimes I love the way you swing the blade at everything in sight!

Separate me from my own two hands, I've killed so many times
But I can't save the world from the creatures that don't die

I kinda like the way you tell me, "Baby, please come home
I need you here right now
I'm crying underwater so you don't hear the sound"

Burst into flames, scream in the dark!
I'm gonna light up this place!
Oh, oh, oh, yeah!

And I will be the only light
I'll be the only light!
