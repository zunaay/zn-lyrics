Worn out and faded
The weakness starts to show
They've created the generation
That we know
Washed up and hated
The system moves so slow
They give us answers
To questions they dont even know

You made it, you played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it, you played it
Your shit is overrated

Ised up and Jaded
You're thinking way too slow
So we're creating answers
On our own
We can't relate
To what you think you know
And you create
The problems that will never
Go away

You made it, you played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it, you played it
Your shit is overrated

You made it, you played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it, you played it
Your shit is over

Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away

You made it, you played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it, you played it
Your shit is overrated

You made it, you played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it, you played it
Your shit is over
