Sunshine, there ain't a thing that you can do
That's gonna ruin my night
(But there's just something about you)
This dizzy dreamer and his bleeding little blue boy
Licking your fingers like you're done and
You've decide there is so much more than me
And baby honestly it's harder breathing next to you, I shake
I brought a gun in as the preacher tried to stop me
Hold my heart is beating for you anyway

What if I can't forget you?
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole

Nobody prays for the heartless
Nobody gives another penny for the selfish
(You're learning how to taste what you kill now)
Don't mind me, I'm just reaching for your necklace
Talkin' to my mama about this little girl from Texas

What if I can't forget you?
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole

Just give her back to me
You know I can't afford the medicine that feeds what I need
So baby what if I can't forget you?
(What if I can't forget you?)
Collide invisible lips
Like a shadow on the wall and just throw, oh no
You can't just throw me away

So what if I can't forget you?
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you and what's
So good about picking up the pieces?
What if I don't even want to?

What if I can't forget you?
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole

Just give her back to me
You know I can't afford the medicine that feeds what I need
So baby what if I can't forget you?
(What if I can't forget you?)
I'd better learn to live alone

What's so good about picking up the pieces?
What's so good about?
What's so good about?
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
