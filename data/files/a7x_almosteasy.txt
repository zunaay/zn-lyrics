I feel insane every single time I'm asked to compromise
'Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways
And that's the way it stays
So how long did I expect love to outweigh ignorance?
By that look on your face, I may have forced the scale to tip

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother) come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all) come back again, it's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart from the things I've done to you
It's hard to face, but the fact remains that this is nothing new
I left you bound and tied with suicidal memories
Selfish beneath the skin, but deep inside, I'm not insane

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother) come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all) come back again, it's almost easy
(You'll learn your lesson) come back to me, it's almost easy
(But first you'll fall) come back again, it's almost easy

Now that I've lost you, it kills me to say (hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away
I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong
Now let me make it right (make it all right)

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother) come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all) come back again, it's almost easy
(You'll learn your lesson) come back to me, it's almost easy
(But still you fall) come back again, it's almost easy
