Took me down to the river
So I could drown drown drown
Looking up trough the water
I kept sinking down down down

I feel like I'm dying
I've got one foot in the ground
Never knew what love was
Until you came around

You're going down
You're going down down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down

Take it down to the basement
You look around round round
And we sit there in silence
I watch you go down down down

I feel like I'm flying
I've got my head in the clouds
Never thought I was crazy
Until you came around

You're going down
You're going down down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down

You're going down down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down

Took me down to the river
So I could drown drown drown

You're going down
You're going down down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down
(Down down down)

You're going down down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down
