Don't know what's going on
Don't know what went wrong
Feels like a hundred years
I still can't believe you're gone

So, I'll stay up all night
With these bloodshot eyes
While these walls surround me
With the story of our life

I feel so much better
Now, that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't
Miss you at all

I'm not lying, denying
That I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever

Now things are coming clear
And I don't need you here
And in this world around me
I'm glad you disappeared

So I'll stay out all night
Get drunk and fucking fight
Until the morning comes
I'll forget about our life

I feel so much better
Now, that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't
Miss you at all

I'm not lying, denying
That I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever

First time you screamed at me
I should have made you leave
I should have known
It could be so much better

I hope you're missing me
I hope I've made you see
That I'm gone forever

And now it's coming clear
That I don't need you here
And in this world around me
I'm glad you disappeared

I feel so much better
Now, that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't
Miss you at all

I'm not lying, denying
That I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever

And now you're gone forever
And now you're gone forever
