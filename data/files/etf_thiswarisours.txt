We have to find a better way
Out of this tragedy
As the battle rages on
Blood stains the ground we're on
My ears hear only screams
Brave soldiers are dying
One spartan stands alone (and shouts)
This war is ours
This war is ours

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
(We have to find a better way)
And I will stand my
Ground until the end
'Till we conquer them all
(We have to find a better way)

Oh!

Through the fire and the flames
A sea of dead drives me insane
We march the fight into the cold
This is as far as it will go
The batle ends on the top here
This is where we conquer them
On blackout armed with you swords
This war is ours, yeah
This war is ours

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
(We have to find a better way)
And I will stand my
Ground until the end
'Till we conquer them all
(We have to find a better way)
'Till we conquer them all

Oh!

Yes, I will need you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
And I will stand my
Ground until the end
'Till we conquer them all

We will conquer them all
We will conquer them all
We will conquer them all

Oh!

This war is ours, yeah
This war is ours

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
And I will stand my
Ground until the end
'Till we conquer them all

Oh

So I will fight my
Battle 'till I fall
And I conquer them all (war, war)
'Till we conquer them all
(War, war, war, war, war)

Go
Yeah

This is war
War, war, war, war, war, war, war
This is war!
