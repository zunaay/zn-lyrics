I can see it following
My every step and every sin
Buried in this hole I'm in
I fail, I lose I never win

No need to bring the shame to my attention
No need to bring the shame to my

To a place full of clarity, it shakes
It all makes sense to me
A hit's just a taste
A hit's just a taste
Away is where I'll be for days
The state when my heads not straight
A hit's just a taste
A hit's just a taste

I found the way rock bottom feels
Life seems much more pretty here
Toxic dirty crystal clear
That is how it's engineered

No need to bring the shame to my attention
No need to bring the shame to my

To a place full of clarity, it shakes
It all makes sense to me
A hit's just a taste
A hit's just a taste
Away is where I'll be for days
The state when my heads not straight
A hit's just a taste
A hit's just a taste

Don't you dare bring the shame to my attention
We've been over this before, so don't you dare

I can see it following
My every step and every sin

To a place full of clarity, it shakes
It all makes sense to me
A hit's just a taste
A hit's just a taste
Away is where I'll be for days
The state when my heads not straight
A hit's just a taste
A hit's just a taste
