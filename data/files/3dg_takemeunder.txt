Now it seems I'm fading
All my dreams are not worth saving
I've done my share of waiting
And I've still got nowhere else to go
So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Seems you're wanting me to stay
But my dreams would surely waste away
And I still have nowhere else to go
So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Now it seems you're leaving
But we've only just begun
And you've still got nowhere else to go
So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

And I've been waiting so long
And I've been waiting so long
And I've been waiting so long

So I wait for you to
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

And I've been waiting so long
And I've been waiting so long
And I've been waiting so long

So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way
