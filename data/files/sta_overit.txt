I'm addicted to the pain
That I've created for myself
Alone and on the outside
Always trying to be someone else
This weight on my shoulders
Where did I go wrong
My soul is so cold
And I hate what I've become

If I don't find a way, is it over
If I don't blame myself is it gone
All of this time I've wasted
Or will I make it out
From under this world before it falls
I'm over it all
(I'm over it all)

I'll admit that I'm ashamed
'Cause I've been lying to myself
My throne is rusted from the years of living in this hell
I take so much shit
Is this where I belong
My heart is so charred and I hate what I've become

If I don't find a way is it over
If I don't blame myself is it gone
All of this time I've wasted
Or will I make it out from under this world before it falls
I'm over it

I can feel the walls closing in on me
And I can see the sun changing turning gray
It's all coming down on me

If I don't find a way is it over (If I don't find a way)
If I don't blame myself is it gone (Is it gone?)
All of this time I've wasted
Or will I make it out
From under this world before it falls
I'm over it all
I'm over it
