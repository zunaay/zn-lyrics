We wait for the world to change
But our time's running out
How did this get so strange?
Is this the way it plays out?
How long till we've decided
To take back what we've lost?
With no reason to fight it
There's no lines left to cross
But we will try once more

All of the life I've lived without
Always leaving me with no doubt
All of your lies that you belt out
Chew me up then spit me out
All of the words I scream and shout
I'd take them back if I knew how
Nothing can save me from myself
I've never felt so low

I slipped into a brand new dimension
And they're telling me I shouldn't be afraid
But the future that they promised is different than what's upon us
Get me out of this digital masquerade, okay
It's like no one's listening and one's learning
It's a bad position, it's so concerning, yeah
I'm sick of the people that lie to my face, I'm sick of the rat race
So chew me up and spit me out until you get a good taste, yeah
I don't care anymore, you can tear me apart like a true carnivore

All of the life I've lived without
Always leaving me with no doubt
All of your lies that you belt out
Chew me up then spit me out
All of the words I scream and shout
I'd take them back if I knew how
Nothing can save me from myself
I've never felt

So small as I do now
So small as I do now

All of the life I've lived without
Always leaving me with no doubt
All of your lies that you belt out
Chew me up then spit me out
All of the words I scream and shout
I'd take them back if I knew how
Nothing can save me from myself
I've never felt so low
