This shining city built of gold, a far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye round here
Look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil
There sat a 7-headed beast, 10 horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
But hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The beast and the harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is babylon the great

The city dressed in jewels and gold, fine linen, myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once as her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world, sailors navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss with her sins piled to the sky
The beast and the harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is babylon the great

The day has come for all us sinners
If you're not a servant you'll be struck to the ground
Flee the burning, greedy city looking back on her to see there's nothing around
I don't believe in fairy tales and no one wants to go to hell
You've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see
Now, if you wanna serve above, or be a king, below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is babylon the great

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is babylon the great
