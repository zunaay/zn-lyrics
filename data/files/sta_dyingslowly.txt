Why am I so numb?
Why do I feel so dumb?
When it's just you and I
It's there look in your eye
How did you do this to me?
Make me feel so alive
Why did you do this to me
So I can't survive?

I feel so alone now
There's no way out now because

Without you I can see
I would be just another
Sad junkie, mindless freak
Losing sleep dying slowly
Dying slowly
Dying slowly

I know it's not your fault
There's nothing wrong with you at all
When it's just me and you
I feel there's nothing I could do
And there's nothing I could say
I'm still so scared of the day
This fucked up world tries to take you away

I feel so alone now
There's no way out now because

Without you I can see
I would be just another
Sad junkie, mindless freak
Losing sleep dying slowly
Dying slowly
Dying slowly

I've never been so loving
I've never felt so alone
I wanna just feel something more than
Dying slowly
I'm dying slowly

Why am I so numb?
Why do I feel so dumb?
Why should I even try
When I can't survive

Without you I can see
I would be just another
Sad junkie, mindless freak
Losing sleep dying slowly
Dying slowly
Dying
I'm dying
Dying slowly
