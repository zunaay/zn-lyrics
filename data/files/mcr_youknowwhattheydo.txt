In the middle of a gun fight
In the center of a restaurant
They say come with your arms raised high
Well, they're never gonna get me
Like a bullet through a flock of doves
To wage this war against your faith in me
Your life will never be the same
On your mother's eyes
Say a prayer
Say a prayer, yeah

Now, but I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't, well, I can, yeah
Too much, too late
Or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again

They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost
My cellmate's a killer
They make me do pushups in drag
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself
Am I losing myself?
Well, I miss my mom!
Will they give me the chair?
Or lethal injection or swing from a rope if you dare
Ah, nobody knows all the trouble I've seen

Now, but I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't, well, I can, yeah
Too much, too late
Or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again

To your room
What they ask of you
Will make you want to say so long
But I don't remember
Why remember you?

Do you have the keys to the hotel?
'Cause I'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire! Fire!

Life is but a dream for the dead
And, well, I, I won't go down by myself
But I'll go down with my friends

Now, now, now, now (I can't explain)
Now, now, now, (I can't complain)
Now, now, yeah, yeah!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, haha
