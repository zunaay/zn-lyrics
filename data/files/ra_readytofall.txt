Hold on slow down
Again from the top now
And tell me everything
I know I've been gone for
What seems like forever
But I'm here now waiting
To convince you that
I'm not a ghost or a stranger
But closer than you think
She said: just go on to what you
Pretend is your life but
Please don't die on me

Wings won't take me
Heights don't phase me
So take a step
But don't look down
Take a step

Now I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall
I'm think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong
I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall

Perpetual motion 
The image won't focus
A blur is all that's in
But here in this moment
Like the eye of the storm
It all came clear to me
I found a shoulder to lean on
An infallible reason
To live all by itself
I took one last look from
The heights that I once loved
And then I ran like hell

Wings won't take me
Heights don't phase me
So take a step
But don't look down
Take a step

Now I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall
I'm think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong
I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall

I count the times that I've been sorry
(I know, I know)
Now my conventions slowly drowns
(I know, I know)
If there's a time these walls could guard you
(I know, I know)
Then let that time be right now

Now I'm standing on a rooftop
Now I'm standing on a rooftop
Ready to fall

I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall
I'm think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong
I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall

Now I'm standing on a rooftop (ready to fall)
Now I'm standing on a rooftop (ready to fall)
Now I'm standing on a rooftop (ready to fall)
Now I'm standing on a rooftop (ready to fall)
