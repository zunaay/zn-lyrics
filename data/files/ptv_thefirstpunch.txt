(Where you from fool?!)
(This world is about to change)
One, two
One, two, three, four!

Look into my eyes
And look at the words you say
Blood on your tongue with a crass embrace
I found a kiss on the day we met and said
This will be a night we won't forget

Speak slow now, I don't wanna miss when you cry
Glass over diamond blue eyes

And it's good enough to make me wanna fall in love
So move a little bit closer
Hear the sound of your voice
We're screaming, why can't we just be friends?
It's not that easy, but it's half of the fun
To see you throw the first punch

Now! It's such a shame you had to go and run your mouth
Life is what you make it, but at least I've got real friends!
Can you hear me now?
Now that I'm a big star!
Fuck you and your new love for yourself!
(It don't mean shit)

And it's good enough to make me wanna fall in love
So move a little bit closer
Hear the sound of your voice
We're screaming, why can't we just be friends?
It's not that easy, but it's half of the fun
To see you throw the first punch

Now, I've got so much to give
But I would kill just to feel less invisible
And you've got so much to learn about gravity
So live it up baby, don't look down
Live it up baby, don't look down

And it's good enough to make me wanna fall in love
So move a little bit closer
Hear the sound of your voice
We're screaming, why can't we just be friends?
It's not that easy, but it's half of the fun
And I saw it coming when you threw the first punch
You threw the first punch
Now it's your turn to run!

This is the breath that will take my life
There's no future but matches and propane
And through the mutated words I write
Kill it fast and never watch it die
