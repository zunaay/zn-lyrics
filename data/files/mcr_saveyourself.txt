Are you all ready where you are?
Are you all ready where you are?
Are you all ready where you are?
And I'm coming for you now

Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Right Now!

I hope you're ready for a firefight
'Cause the devil's got your number tonight
(They say) we'll never leave this place alive
But if you sing these words we'll never die

Get off the ledge and drop the knife
Not a victim of a victim's life
(Because) this ain't a room full of suicides
We're believers, I believe tonight

We can leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever if you've got the time

Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
If you save yourself tonight
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
If you save yourself tonight

I'll tell you all how the story ends
Where the good guys die and the bad guys win (Who cares?)
It ain't about all the friends you made
But the graffiti they write on your grave

For all of us who've seen the light
Salute the dead and lead the fight
Who gives a damn if we lose the war
Let the walls come down, let the engines roar.

We can leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever if you've got the time
Woah!

I'm the only friend who makes you cry
Your heart attack in black hair dye
So just save yourself and I'll hold them back tonight

Are you ready where you are?
If you save yourself tonight
'Cause they're coming for you
Can you save yourself tonight?

Right now!

'Cause I'll hold them back

We could leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever if you've got the time!
You motherfucker!
Woah!

You're the broken glass in the morning light
Be a burning star if it takes all night
So just save yourself and I'll hold them back tonight

Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
If you save yourself tonight
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Can you save yourself tonight?
