All right, all right
Everybody pay attention to me!
I got the answer
I got the answer

Street walking cheetah
With a capitol G
So get your hands up,
Now get your hands up

Hide your eyes, we're gonna shine tonight
Sub-atomic never get the best of me
Ain't a DJ gonna save my soul
I sold it long ago for rock 'n' roll
Drop the needle when the tape deck blows
Gotta shout this out so everybody knows

This ain't a party
Get off the dance floor
You want the get down
Here comes the gang war
You're doin' alright
I got the answer
'Cause all the good times
They give you cancer

If we were all like you in the end
Oh we'd be killing ourselves by sleeping in
So hit the lights I'll do it again
And keep your cars, and your dogs, and your famous friends

Slide up the faders when the cabinet slams
And get your hands up,
Now get your hands up

Light up the stage
And watch me kick out the jams
So throw a fist up,
Now throw your fist up

Ain't nobody gonna take me life
Ain't nobody gonna get the best of me
Ain't a preacher gonna save me now
Grab a seat, I'm gonna show you how

Everybody hit the pyro cue
We're gonna blow this off and show you what we do

This ain't a party
Get off the dance floor
You want the get down
Here comes the gang war
You're doin' alright
I got the answer
'Cause all the good times
They give you cancer

If we were all like you in the end
Oh we'd be killing ourselves by sleeping in
So hit the lights I'll do it again
And keep your cars, and your dogs, and your famous friends

We came to party
Kill the party tonight
We came to party
Kill the party tonight, let's go

This ain't a party
Get off the dance floor
You want the get down
Here comes the gang war
You're doin' alright
I got the answer
'Cause all the good times
Gimme gimme good times people tonight

This ain't a party
Get off the dancefloor
You wanna get down
Here comes the encore

If we were all like you in the end
Oh we'd be killing ourselves by sleeping in
So hit the lights I'll do it again

So everybody get down
Till the party breaks down
Now everybody get down
Now everybody get down
Till the party breaks down tonight
