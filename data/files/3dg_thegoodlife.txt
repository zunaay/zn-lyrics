The good life is what I need
Too many people stepping over me
The only thing that has been on my mind
The one thing I need before I die

All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, the good life
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, the good life

I don't really know who I am
Its time for me to take a stand
I need a change and I need it fast
I know that any day could be the last

All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, the good life
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, the good life

Hold on, hold on
I always wanted it this way
(I never wanted it this way)
Hold on, hold on
I always wanted it this way
(We didn't ask for it this way)
I always wanted it this way

(The good life)
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, the good life
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, the good life

Woo

(The good life)
