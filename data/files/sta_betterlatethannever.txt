Woah, oh
Woah, oh
Woah, oh, oh

I took my time, tried to figure it out
I took some shots to my chest and became a burnout
I found my stride, tried to bury the past
And I always took chances and always finished last

I know I was meant for something more
More than beaten, bloody, blacked out on the floor
It took time to get it right
But I'm here and it's forever
I will never be the man I was before
It's better late than never

I draw the line, there is no doubt
If I cross it, I lose and I drown
I found my stride, no need to bury the past
Now I always take chances and never finish last

I know I was meant for something more
More than beaten, bloody, blacked out on the floor
It took time to get it right
But I'm here and it's forever
I will never be the man I was before
It's better late than never
It's better late than never
It's better late than never

I know I was meant for something more
More than beaten, bloody, blacked out on the floor
It took time to get it right
But I'm here and it's forever
I will never be the man I was before
It's better late than never

Woah, oh
Woah, oh
Woah, oh, oh
It's better late than never
Woah, oh
Woah, oh
Woah, oh, oh
It's better late than never
