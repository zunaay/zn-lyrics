We all fall down together
Nothing lasts forever
This is not the end
Are you listening?

Have we been poisoned from the inside?
'Cause we're still burning at the ends
Have we been standing on an empire?
When every floor is made of sand

We all fall down together
Nothing lasts forever
This is not the end
Are you listening?

We're all in this together
But nothing lasts forever
This is not the end
Are you listening to the sirens?
The sirens
The sirens
The sirens

Do you still see it in the distance?
Can you still read the warning signs?
Do you believe in our existence?
'Cause I believe in us tonight

We all fall down together
Nothing lasts forever
This is not the end
Are you listening?

We're all in this together
But nothing lasts forever
This is not the end
Are you listening to the sirens?
The sirens
The sirens

Another brick in the wall
We were born to resist it if it falls
Come with me, we will rise
Can I believe it tonight?
(Can I believe it tonight?)
(Can I believe it tonight?)

We're all in this together
Nothing lasts forever
This is not the end
Are you listening?

We're all in this together
But nothing lasts forever
This is not the end
Are you listening to the sirens?
The sirens
The sirens
The sirens, the sirens
The sirens, sirens, sirens, sirens

The sirens
(The sirens)
(The sirens)
(The sirens)
