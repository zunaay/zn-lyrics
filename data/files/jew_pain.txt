I don't feel the way I've ever felt, 
I know
I'm gonna smile and not get worried
I try but it shows

Anyone can make what I have built
And better now
Anyone can find the same white pills
It takes my pain away

It's a lie, a kiss with opened eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind these are horrid times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me

I never thought I'd walk away from you
I did
But it's a false sense of accomplishment
Every time I quit

Anyone can see my every flaw
It isn't hard
Anyone can say they're above this all
It takes my pain away

It's a lie, a kiss with opened eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind these are horrid times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me

I can't let it bother me

It takes my pain away

It's a lie, a kiss with opened eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind, these are horrid times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me (it takes my pain)
It takes my pain
It takes my pain
It takes my pain away
