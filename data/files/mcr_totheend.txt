He calls the mansion not a house, but a tomb
He's always chokin' from the stench and the fume
The weddin' party all collapsed in the room
So send my resignation to the bride and the groom
(Let's go down)

This elevator only goes up to ten
He's not around, he's always looking at men (Oh-oh-oh)
Down by the pool, he doesn't have many friends
As (Oh-oh) they are face-down and bloated
Snap a shot with the lens

If you marry me, would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?

(Say goodbye) To the vows you take
(Say goodbye) To the life you make
(And say goodbye) To the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank

Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh

She keeps a picture of the body she lends
Got nasty blisters from the money she spends
She's got a life of her own and it shows by the Benz
She drives at ninety by the Barbies and Kens
If you ever say never too late
I'll forget all the diamonds you ate (Oh-oh-oh)
Lost in coma and covered in cake (Oh-oh)
Increase the medication, share the vows at the wake
(Kiss the bride)

If you marry me, would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?

(Say goodbye) To the vows you take
(Say goodbye) To the life you make
(And say goodbye) To the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank

(And say goodbye) To the last parade
(And walk away) From the choice you made
(And say goodnight) To the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank

Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh

(Say goodbye) To the vows you take
(Say goodbye) To the life you make
(And say goodbye) To the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank

(And say goodbye) To the last parade
(And walk away) From the choice you made
(Say goodnight) To the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank

(Woah-oh) To the last parade
(Woah-oh) When the parties fade
(Woah-oh) And the choice you made
To the end
