I'm on my way through everyday
I'm facing all my faults
All alone, no way home
Afraid to lose it all

I hear you screaming, bleeding out of the hunter
I open my eyes and now I realize I'm just the game
Torn away from my home, left me crawling
Everything is falling, now I'm the hunted
I'm the hunted

On your face, a thousand ways
To kill me where I stand
Scarred again, there's no end
This war that I began

I hear you screaming, bleeding out of the hunter
I open my eyes and now I realize, I'm just the game
Torn away from my home, left me crawling
Everything is falling, now I'm the hunted
I'm the hunted (I'm the hunted)

It never seems to let me be with it's teeth in me
Now I'm the hunted
It never seems to let me be with it's teeth in me
Now I'm the hunted
It never seems to let me be with it's teeth in me
Now I'm the hunted
It never seems to let me be, it's hunting me

I hear you screaming, bleeding out of the hunter
I open my eyes and now I realize, I'm just the game
Torn away from my home, left me crawling
Everything I know is falling, falling down on me
Now I'm the hunted

I'm the hunted
Hunted!
