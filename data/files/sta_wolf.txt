It's hard to face all the feelings
Pretending that I'm not bleeding
I'm out of my head, I'm leaving for dead
Heart skips, pulse hits the ceiling
Cold sweats, the nightmare revealing
It's all in my head

When it all goes down
The darkness comes out
The darkness comes out

When it all goes down
The savage comes out
Everyone's a wolf, everyone's a wolf
When the wall's at your back
You're under attack
E-e-everyone, everyone's a wolf

I'm tracking the moves that you're making
I sense you're not far from breaking
In the unknown, I'm not alone
Feeding on lies and betrayal
This coffin's on its final nail
It's all in my head

When it all goes down
The darkness comes out
The darkness comes out

When it all goes down
The savage comes out
Everyone's a wolf, everyone's a wolf
When the wall's at your back
You're under attack
E-e-everyone's a wolf

We're biting, we're crawling
Never giving up, never giving up, yeah
We're killing, surviving
When's enough enough?
Everyone, everyone's a wolf

When it all goes down
The savage comes out
Everyone's a wolf, everyone's a wolf
When the wall's at your back
You're under attack
E-e-everyone's a wolf

We're biting, we're crawling
Never giving up, never giving up, yeah
We're killing, surviving
When's enough enough?
Everyone, everyone's a wolf
Everyone, everyone's a wolf
