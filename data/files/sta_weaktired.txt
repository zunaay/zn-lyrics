We try to plan our lives ahead
And figure everything out right now
Losing sense of our own impermanence
We watch our lives pass by somehow

You get weak
You get tired
You burn yourself in your own fire

Our eyes show pain of regret
We lost ourselves, we lost our souls
Searched everywhere and we're never getting out
So why are we here?
Tell me why are we here?
We're never getting out

We walk a very thin fine line
Writing our names in the sand
And I bury myself from the outside in
While the waves wash away my plans

I get weak
I get tired
I burn myself in my own fire

Our eyes show pain of regret
We lost ourselves, we lost our souls
Searched everywhere and we're never getting out
So why are we here?
Tell me why are we here?
We're never getting out

Our eyes show pain of regret
We lost ourselves, we lost our souls
Searched everywhere and we're never getting out
So why are we here?
Tell me why are we here?
We're never getting out
