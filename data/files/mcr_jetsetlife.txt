Gaze into her killing jar I'd sometimes stare for hours
She even poked the holes so I can breathe
She bought the last line
I'm just the worst kind
Of guy to argue
With what you might find
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie with you?

Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all to come down this time

Lost in the prescription she's got something else in mind
Check into the Hotel Bella Muerte
It gives the weak flight
It gives the blind sight
Until the cops come
Or by the last light
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie next to you?

Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all to come down this time

Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all to come down this time

Pull the plug
But I'd like to learn your name
When holding on
Well I hope you do the same
Awww sugar
Slip into the tragedy you've spun this chamber dry

Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all to come down this time

Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all to come down this time

Pull the plug
But I'd like to learn your name
And holding on
Well I hope you do the same
Awww sugar
