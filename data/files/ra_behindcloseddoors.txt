Chairs thrown and tables toppled
Hands armed with broken bottles
Standing no chance to win but
We're not running, we're not running

There's a point I think we're missing
It's in the air we raise our fists in
In the smiles we cast each other
My sister, my brother

About the time we gave up hope and
We never find these locks still open
Stumbling on stones unturned
The hurt we feel, we all have found

The lives we've lost in such a change
But all they see is treason

Although we have no obligation to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors

Bonfires burn like beacons
Guiding the lost and weakened
Flames dance on crashing waves
Guiding ships who've gone a stray

Time out, let's stop and think this through
We've all got better things to do
A talk in circles run in place
Answers inches from my face

Although we have no obligation to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors

Black eyes, broken fingers
Blood drips and I let it run
Down my lips and to my swollen gums
When hope is non-existent
Our instincts all scream: run
We never turn our backs or even bite our tongue

Although we have no obligation to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors

(Behind closed doors)

Although we have no obligation to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors
