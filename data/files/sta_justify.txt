Would you ever compromise
See life through someone else's eyes
Confess to being a disgrace
While your past stares you in the face

I can't help hear the words you say
Laughing while you throw your friends away

I knew all along
From the day I left
You'd fall apart

You try to justify
I've seen it all I've heard it all
You try to justify
I've watched you fall
I'll watch you crawl again

Look at me in the eyes
What you see is no disguise
I'm changing who I was before
While your trust in me lies on the floor
The tears are falling down your face
Realizing that I've been replaced

I knew all along from the day I left
You'd fall apart

You try to justify
I've seen it all I've heard it all
You try to justify
I've watched you fall
I'll watch you crawl again
Watch you crawl again
(I'll watch you crawl again)

You're so lost inside yourself
You're so stuck inside your little hell
With no way out

Don't try to justify
I've seen it all
I've seen it all
Don't try to justify
I've watched you fall
I've watched you fall
Don't try to justify
I've seen it all i've heard it all
Don't try to justify
(I'll watch you crawl again)
(Watch you crawl again)
