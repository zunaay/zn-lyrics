I walk alone
Think of home
Memories of long ago
No one knows I lost my soul long ago

Lied too much
She said that she's had enough
Am I too much
She said that she's had enough

Standing on my own
Remembering the one I left at home
Forget about the life I used to know
Forget about the one I left at home

I need to run far away
Can't go back to that place
Like she told me
I'm just a big disgrace

Lied too much
She said that she's had enough
Am I too much
She said that she's had enough

Standing on my own
Remembering the one I left at home
Forget about the life I used to know
Forget about the one I left at home
So now I'm standing here alone
I'm learning how to live life on my own

Lied too much
I think that I've had enough
Am I too much
She said that she's had enough

I'm standing on my own
Remembering the one I left at home
Forget about the life I used to know
Forget about the one I left at home

So now I'm standing here alone
I'm learning how to live life on my own
Forget about the past I'll never know
Forget about the one I left at home
