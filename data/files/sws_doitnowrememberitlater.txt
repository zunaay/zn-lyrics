I've seen this place before, back when I was young
And I had something more to prove
Now that I'm older, I've seen all the things that I want
And I'm ready to make my move
We'll stare straight-faced, don't hesitate
See, why would we wanna make you bastards wait?
Thank God I got the chance, now I can say

So now we'll say, we'll say...
(We're gonna do what we want)

Remember when they said that what we want could never be done?
When it all comes falling down, we'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to, yeah!
Remember when they said that what we want could never be done?
Well look who's laughing now, we'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to, yeah!

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh

Oh my, don't they hate to see us try?
Come on, say what you think, it won't mean a thing
In the end we're gonna be just fine
We'll stare straight-faced, don't hesitate
See, why would we wanna make you bastards wait?
Thank God I got the chance, now I can say

So now we'll say, we'll say...
(We're gonna do what we want)

Remember when they said that what we want could never be done?
When it all comes falling down, we'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to, yeah!
Remember when they said that what we want could never be done?
Well look who's laughing now, we'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to, yeah!

We'll do what we want
Right now, come on, come on
With or without you
We have a brand-new perspective
Don't you cross the line, don't you cross that line

We'll do what we want
Right now, come on, come on
With or without you
Don't you cross the line, don't you cross that line

Remember when they said that what we want could never be done?
When it all comes crashing down, we'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to, yeah!

Remember when they said that what we want could never be done?
When it all comes falling down, we'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to, yeah!
Remember when they said the world we want could never be done?
Well look who's laughing now, we'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to, yeah!

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh
