Jealousy's an ugly word, but you don't seem to care
Converse behind my back, but now I'm here
Need no one to comply with me though everyone that I defeat
Don't need you, fuck camaraderie, this rage will never go away

Hatred fuels my blood, I'll burn ya down (you can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall, I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (see it in my eyes)
Now I can understand, it's sorrow that feeds your lies

You're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe
A crutch for you that won't always be there
Hide in the dark another day, the fear in you is here to stay
So keep the fuck away from me, and learn to trust the words I say

Hatred fuels my blood, I'll burn ya down (you can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall, I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (witness and see it in my eyes)
Now I can understand (put faith in you for the last time)
It's sorrow that feeds your lies

Run from me before I tear you down (be afraid)
You chose the wrong side (it feels so right)
I won't help you, let you rot away (despise what you say)
Run towards the light exposing your soul (we won't be there by your side)
Salvation's dying (somebody's crying)
We're all gone in the end, sweet child we'll miss you
Oh, so far away, far away

I can't trust anyone (witness and see it in my eyes)
Now I can understand (put faith in you for the last time)
It's sorrow that feeds your lies

Falling away, can't turn back time
Burned it down anyway
