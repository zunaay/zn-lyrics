Don't try
To figure me out
I'm aware
That's somehow
I've learnt to
Give all of me all the way

All of the years
I've wasted here
Looking to find my home

We better find a way to make it all calm down
Better find a way to make it all work out
Better find a way to make it all drop down
Better off here
We better find a way to make it through this life
Better find a way to make it out alright
Better say goodbye
I'm better off here on my own

Don't think
I can't see
I've lost all the gains
That I've laid beside you
Thrown pieces of us away

All of the years
I've wasted here
Looking to find my home

We better find a way to make it all calm down
Better find a way to make it all work out
Better find a way to make it all drop down
Better off here
We better find a way to make it through this life
Better find a way to make it out alright
Better say goodbye
I'm better off here on my own

We better find a way to make it all calm down
Better find a way to make it all work out
Better find a way to make it all drop down
Better off here
Better find a way to make it through this life
Better find a way to make it out alright
Better say goodbye
I'm better off here on my own

Better off here on my own
Own
