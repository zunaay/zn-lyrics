Look at my face
I hope it haunts you 'till the end
You left me here for dead when you walked away
How does it taste
To know that you were wrong?
And now I get to watch you crawl
All the way back to me

Guess I let you get away with everything
Never called you out on anything
Had your back because you needed me
Now I'm standing here alone

Every time I think about it
You were a perfect mistake
Lesson learned
It was never forever, I can do better
Every time I think about it
Know that you were just in my way
Now I know
It was never forever, I can do better now

Look at this place
Scattered with an empty silence
Every scream and every crisis
It stays with me
How can you face yourself
Knowing how you were so evil?
Like poison in a needle
And the vein was me

Guess I let you get away with everything
Never called you out on anything
Had your back because you needed me
Now I'm standing here alone

Every time I think about it
You were a perfect mistake
Lesson learned
It was never forever, I can do better
Every time I think about it
Know that you were just in my way
Now I know
It was never forever, I can do better now

Look at my face
I hope it haunts you 'till the end

Every time I think about it
You were a perfect mistake
Lesson learned
It was never forever, I can do better
Every time I think about it
Know that you were just in my way
Now I know
It was never forever, I can do better now
It was never forever, I can do better now
Now
