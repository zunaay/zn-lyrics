We're losing daylight, but I can't work any faster
Under the veil of dusk, we go on
Don't close your eyes!
What if it all disappears in the shadows?
Now, reach for the stars!

If I held my ground, would you ask me to change?
This drought bleeds on, now we're dancing for rain
We drink the air, but it's still not the same
These worlds collide, but the distance remains
We point the finger, never accept the blame
And I know... ooh, and I know

The waters come, but the fire still rages on here
The men all shrugged their shoulders and left
We sleep so sound in rooms just up the stairs
Will you save us like you saved them?

If I held my ground, would you ask me to change?
This drought bleeds on, now we're dancing for rain
We drink the air, but it's still not the same
These worlds collide, but the distance remains
We point the finger, never accept the blame
And I know... ooh, and I know

You've bled me dry, but I'm still breathing
I swear I'm sucking dry the sky
And you won't ever find us kneeling
Or swallowing your lies

If I held my ground, would you ask me to change?
This drought bleeds on, now we're dancing for rain
We drink the air, but it's still not the same
These worlds collide, but the distance remains
We point the finger, never accept the blame
And I know... ooh, and I know

This drought bleeds on... this drought bleeds on
