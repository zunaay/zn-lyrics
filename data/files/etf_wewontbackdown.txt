We're gonna burn your city
Gonna bring your system down
I'm gonna drown my pity
Turn this to a ghost town

And when you know there's nothing left
You're gonna run like all the rest
Pack your bags and turn your back
On all the friends you had left

And it's time for us to live
Yeah!

It's my time
This is just a declaration
Of our vows (Whoa)
We won't back down
It's my time
This is just your resignation
From our lives (Whoa)
We won't back down

We're gonna drown your ego
You're the legend no one knows
You're an honest fake I know
(You're an honest fake I know)
So now I drown my pity
In a pool of sorrow and shame
Until the day I forget your name

And you gotta let me live
Yeah!

It's my time
This is just a declaration
Of our vows (Whoa)
We won't back down
It's my time
This is just your resignation
From our lives (Whoa)
We won't back down
We won't back down

It's time to forget what makes me sick
Deep inside of me (deep inside of me)
And it's time to forget what makes me sick
Deep inside of me, yeah

And you gotta let me live
Yeah!

It's my time
This is just a declaration
Of our vows (Whoa)
We won't back down
It's my time
This is just your resignation
From our lives (Whoa)
We won't back down
We won't back down

We won't back down
We won't back down
