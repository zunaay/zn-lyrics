I remember the way it felt
Your voice inside my head
Like an ocean crashing waves punching through my hull
And the day I tried to live I understood it all

Where are you, where are you, where are you now?

It's the way life goes
When we are waken we get taken
No one knows
No I don't believe it, I can't believe it

I sing for the fallen
I sing for the fallen
I sing for the fallen

You had so much left to say
Fighting for your life someway
Now your memory is crawling in my skin all day

Where are you, where are you, where are you now?

It's the way life goes
When we are waken we get taken
No one knows
No I don't believe it, I can't believe it

It's the way life goes
When we are waken we get taken
No one knows
No I don't believe it, I can't believe it

I sing for the fallen
I sing for the fallen
I sing for the fallen

It's the way life goes
When we are waken we get taken
No one knows
No I don't believe it, I can't believe it

It's the way life goes
When we are waken we get taken
No one knows
No I don't believe it, I can't believe it
