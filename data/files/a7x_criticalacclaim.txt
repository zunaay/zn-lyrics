(Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off)
Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow men
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far
A clone

So how does it feel
To know that someone's kid in the heart of America
Has blood on their hands
Fighting to defend your rights
So you can maintain the lifestyle that insults his family's existence?
Well, where I'm from, we have a special salute
We aim high in the air towards all those pompous assholes
Who spend their days pointing fingers (fuck you)

(Shh, be quiet, you might piss somebody off)
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your
Generous hypocrisy, collecting enemies

Tabloid gossip queen, worthless man
(There's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(Right this way, you dug your own grave)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far
A clone

All the way from the east to the west
We got this high society looking down on their very foundation
Constantly reminding us that our actions
Are the cause of all their problems
Pointing their fingers in every direction
Blaming their own nation for who wins elections
They never contributed a fucking thing
To the country they love to criticize

Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see, try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last, but I sure ain't the first

(Shh, be quiet, you might piss somebody off)

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow men
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far
A clone
