I have my mother's dreams
I have my father's eyes
You can't take that from me
Just go ahead and try
The crescent city sleeps
While giants in the sky
Preparing to unleash
Let loose a mighty cry

Can nobody save us
Will anyone try
The bayou is burning
The cypress has died

And all along they're saying

"Help is on the way"
(They said, they said)
"Help is on the way"
(They said, they said)
One by land two by sea
Right there in front of me
Help is on the way

Five thousand feet below
As black smoke engulfs the sky
The ocean floor explodes
Eleven mothers cry
My bones all resonate
A burning llulaby
You can't take that from me
Just go ahead and try

She stands at the shoreline
With hands in the air
Her words pierce the dark night
"Does anyone care?"

And all along they're saying

"Help is on the way"
(They said, they said)
"Help is on the way"
(They said, they said)
One by land two by sea
Right there in front of me
Help is on the way

Right here, right here!
Right here, right here!
Right here, right here!

Choking on the black gold
Upon which we rely
We keep axes in the attics
To see cameras in the sky

"Help is on the way"
They said, they said
"Help is on the way"
They said, they said
We were told just to sit tight
'Cause somebody will soon arrive
Help is on the way

But it never came
It never came

"Help is on the way"
(They said, they said)
"Help is on the way"
(They said, they said)
One by land two by sea
Right there in front of me
Help is on the way

On the way
