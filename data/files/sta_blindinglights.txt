I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
Maybe you can show me how to love, baby

Sin City's cold and empty
No one's around to judge me
I can't see clearly when you're gone

And I said, oh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
And I said, oh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
(Hey)

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby (oh-oh-oh)

The city's cold and empty
No one's around to judge me
I can't see clearly when you're gone

And I said, oh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
And I said, oh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just walking by to let you know
I can never say it on the phone
Will never let you go this time

And I said, oh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
And I said, oh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
(Hey)
