Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over

I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
The streets we traveled on
Will undergo our same lost past

I found you here
Now, please, just stay for a while
I can move on with you around
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile
Holding you till our time is done
We both know the day will come, but
I don't want to leave you

I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory or just one picture

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over

Newborn life replacing all of us
Changing this fable we live in
No longer needed here, so where do we go?
Will you take a journey tonight?
Follow me past the walls of death
But, girl, what if there is no eternal life?

I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory or just one picture

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over
Trials in life
Questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please, tell me what we have is real

So what if I never hold you, yeah
Or kiss your lips again? Woah
So I never wanna leave you
And the memories of us to see
I beg, don't leave me

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over
Trials in life
Questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please, tell me what we have is real

Silence, you lost me
No chance for one more day
Silence, you lost me
No chance for one more day

I'm stuck here alone
(Silence, you lost me) 
(No chance for one more day)
Falling away from you
(Silence, you lost me)
No chance to get back home
(No chance for one more day)

I'm stuck here alone
(Silence, you lost me) 
(No chance for one more day)
Falling away from you
(Silence, you lost me)
No chance to get back home
(No chance for one more day)
