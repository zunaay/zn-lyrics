I was scared but once I thought about, I let it go
Everything she said to me I guess I oughta know
We're all tired of talk when it comes to shove
Put up, put out or stay at home

We'll never be the same
Never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please
I taste you all over my teeth
Never again, just tonight, okay

All at once the music stopped, the feeling went away
An ugly picture me and you, but nothing I can change
You know what happens with the lights back on
The less you know the more you want
(And you want, you want)

We'll never be the same
Never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please
I taste you all over my teeth
Never again, just tonight, okay

We'll never be the same
Never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please
I taste you all over my teeth
Never again, just tonight, okay

We'll never be the same
Never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please
I taste you all over my teeth
Never again, just tonight, okay

We'll never be the same
Never feel this way again
We'll never be the same
Never feel this way again
We'll never be the same
Never feel this way again

Never again, just tonight, okay
