Your bottle's almost empty
You know this can't go on
Because of you my mind is always racing
The needle's breaking your skin
The scar is sinking in
And now your trip begins but
It's all over for
It's all over for

You
For you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for you
For you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over

I know what runs through your blood
You do this all in vain
Because of you my mind is always racing
And it gets under my skin
To see you giving in
And now your trip begins but
It's all over for
It's all over for

You
For you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for you
For you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over

And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
It's all over
And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
It's all over

And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for (You, for you)

And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for (You, for you)

And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
It's all over
