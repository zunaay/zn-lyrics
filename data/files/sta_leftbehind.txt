I scream, I shout
I try to get it out
I fall, it feels like I'm flying
Until I hit the ground

Push came to shove
And I have had enough
I laugh when you lost
You've broken all the trust

In spite of all your ignorance
Your lies have tried to burn me one last time
You're left behind

You scream, you shout
You try to get it out
I fall, it feels like I'm dying
When you come back around

Push came to shove
And I have had enough
I can't stand these lies
And now you're left behind

In spite of all your arrogance
You never thought I'd get this far

Your lies have tried to burn me one last time
You're left behind
This time, my eyes disguise the pain
That's left in me, that's left in me

You're left behind
You're out of sight
You're out of mind
You're left behind

Your lies have tried to burn me one last time
You're left behind
This time, my eyes disguise the pain
That's left in me, that's left in me
