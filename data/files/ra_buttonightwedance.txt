Breathe deep and easy
Swallow this pride
Stare at my shaking hands
Through bone-dry, blood shot eyes
Clock strip the hours
I count the miles
Will you be there waiting
Awake until sunrise

I've traveled in darkness
For what seems like days
I come from the sinkholes
Collapsed under this weight
(Under this weight)
I know not your sorrow
But I know mine
So say you'll stay
And dance with me tonight

In the glow of twilight
Our world is finally calm
I felt it complete me
When the stars give way to dawn
A language universal
But I speak not its tongue
Is this a night that spans forever
Or a dawn that never comes

I've traveled in darkness
For what seems like days
I come from the sinkholes
Collapsed under this weight
(Under this weight)
I know not your sorrow
But I know mine
So say you'll stay
And dance with me tonight

(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight...)

Tomorrow we might wake in
Servitude and silence
I will give you everything
If only you would have me
Tomorrow we will sweat and toil
Our hands will quiver caked with soil
Tomorrow we'll give it one last chance
But tonight we dance
But tonight we dance

And for this I've travel in darkness
For what seems like days
I come from the sinkholes
Collapsed under this weight
(Under this weight)
I know not your sorrow
But I know mine
Just say you'll stay
And dance with me tonight
