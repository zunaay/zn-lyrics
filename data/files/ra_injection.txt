Do you spend your days counting the hours you're awake?
And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
There's a burden you've been burying in spite of all your prayers
There's light turns off inside your heart
Can you remember what it's like to care?

Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe, so

Give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whoa-oh-oh
Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whoa-oh-oh

The trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
If you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
With the memories that haunt us are cherished just the same
As the ones that bring us closer to the sky, no matter how grey
And yet I fall, through these clouds, reaching, screaming

Give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whoa-oh-oh
Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whoa-oh-oh

This grip loosens but it never breaks (Never breaks!)
We carry nothing but a name you will forsake
Your words are always there to break my fall (Break my fall!)
In them I find the comfort to see through it all

Guide me through uncharted waters
Before we lose our way again
Will you be my compass until forever?
Until forever ends?

Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whoa-oh-oh
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whoa-oh-oh

Don't let me go, whoa-oh-oh
Don't let me go, whoa-oh-oh
