I changed your mind
And it appeared
Through stained glass eyes
And colorful tears

Fine
Maybe I'll pretend right now
But I swear to God
I'm gonna change the world
I promise you
Someday we'll tell ourselves
Oh my God, this is paradise

I cherish my
American girl
She holds them down
While I destroy the world
My desperate cries
She don't seem to care

She bites her tongue
And we can tell each other
Baby this is paradise
And it's so goddamn good
Now we live like we should

Fine
Maybe I'll pretend right now
But I swear to God
I'm gonna change the world
I promise you
Someday we'll tell ourselves
Oh my God, this is paradise

Fine
Maybe I'll pretend right now
But I swear to God
I'm gonna change the world
I promise you
Someday we'll tell ourselves
Oh my God, this is paradise
