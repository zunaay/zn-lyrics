Sam the weak accomplice, he knew he had a choice
He always startled easily
With the sound of every voice
A pocket full of access
They take and take and take
Left him with a trigger pointin'
Starin' at his shakes and it goes on
It goes on

She was givin' nothin'
But their selfish lack
They sleep with one eye open
'Cause they know she's comin' back
But she will wait her turn
Absent from concern
The furnace inside her, it burns and burns and burns
And it goes on - on, it goes on

The weaklings never practiced what they preach
They cower down below; that's what you call defeat
And in their darkest hour it's hard to breathe
We try to catch up with the world
But we're so far out of reach (we're so far out of reach)

Leanin' in the dark, stands a spaken man
Slicin' her with his words
Always grabbin' with his hands
And it goes on - on, it goes on

The weaklings never practice what they preach
They cower down below; that's what you call defeat
And in their darkest hour it's hard to breathe
We try to catch up with the world
But we're so far out of reach...

I wish I had warned you of this broken path
With each step you take; you know there's no turnin' back

The weaklings never practiced what they preach
They cower down below; that's what you call defeat
And in their darkest hour it's hard to breathe
We try to catch up with the world
But we're so far out of reach

We try to catch up with the world
We try to catch up with the world
We try to catch up with the world
But we're so far out of reach

We try to catch up with the world
We try to catch up with the world
We try to catch up with the world
But we're so far out of reach
