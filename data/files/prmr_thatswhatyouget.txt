No, sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat, we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why?
All the possibilities, well, I was wrong

That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with
The sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
'Cause I burned
Every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try
Holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities, I'm sure you've heard

That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with
The sound of its beating (beating)
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so (so) inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey

Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh

That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Now I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
