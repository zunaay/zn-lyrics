If you wanted to set me free
Why the fuck wouldn't you say something?
See, I was just over seventeen
Made of poison, cave in free

Oh no, please, don't abandon me
Mother, father, I love you so
But this is just me disguised as me
I'm the killer who burned your home

This home!
What a fuck is this home?
This is the street youth rising up!
