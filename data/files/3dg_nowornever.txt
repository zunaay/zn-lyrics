In this time, are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn't turning around?
It's now or never

We have no use
For the truth
Now is the time for us to lose
Who we are and how we've tried
Taking every step in stride
It's now or never to decide

In this time, are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn't turning around?
It's now or never
In this way, are we learning
Or do we sit here yearning
For this world to stop turning around?
It's now or never

Where's the truth for us to use?
'Cause all we seem to do is lose
Who we are and how we've tried
Are we all the same inside?
It's now or never to decide

In this time, are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn't turning around?
It's now or never
In this way, are we learning
Or do we sit here yearning
For this world to stop turning around?
It's now or never

In this time, are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn't turning around?
It's now or never

In this time, are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn't turning around?
It's now or never
In this way, are we learning
Or do we sit here yearning
For this world to stop turning around?
It's now or never

In this time, are we loving
Why this world isn't turning around?
It's now or never
