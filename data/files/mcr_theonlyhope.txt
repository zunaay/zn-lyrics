Remember me

Where, where will you stand?
When all the lights go out
Across these city streets
Where were you when
All of the ambers fell
I still remember them
Covered in ash, covered in glass
Covered in all my friends
I still think of the bombs they build

If there's a place that I could be
Than I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it out
Because the only hope for me
Is you alone

How it should be?
Many years after the disasters that we've seen
What have we learned?
Other than people burn in purifying flame

I say it's okay
I know you can tell
Though you can see me smile
I still think of the guns they sell

If there's a place that I could be
Then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it out
Because the only hope for me
Is you alone

The only hope for me
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope

If there's a place that I could be
Than I'd be another memory

Can I be the only hope for you
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it out
Because the only hope for me
Is you alone

The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
Alone

The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
Alone

Remember me
