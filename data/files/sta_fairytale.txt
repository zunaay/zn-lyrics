Now the game is over
So do you remember
All the time you spent
Saying things you never really meant?
It was all pretend
And it caught up to you in the end
(Caught up to you in the end)

So your flight has landed
And you're feeling stranded
But you will fake your way through
The wreckage of one more useless day

Just one more day
Just one more useless day

Play the victim again
It keeps getting older
Your story is over

Your fairy tale's at the end
(Fairy tale's at the end)
Your fairy tale's at the end
(Fairy tale's at the end)
You're starting over, again
Your fairy tale's at the end

You want a chance to rewind
Or maybe change your one-track mind
But you're too afraid of changing
So you're locking yourself up
In that safe place
In that same old place
(In that same old place)

Play the victim again
It keeps getting older
Your story is over

Your fairy tale's at the end
(Fairy tale's at the end)
Your fairy tale's at the end
(Fairy tale's at the end)
You're starting over, again
Your fairy tale's at the end

Never thought you'd ever feel this way, again
Now, misery's your only friend

Everything you said but never really meant
Caught up to you in the end

Your fairy tale's at the end
(Fairy tale's at the end)
Your fairy tale's at the end
(Fairy tale's at the end)
You're starting over, again
Your fairy tale's at the end!

Your fairy tale!
Is at the end!

Your fairy tale
Is at the end!
