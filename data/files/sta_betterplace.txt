Get away from me
Hide your shame from me
Get away somehow
You drag me down

Denial's over
Just wait and see
I don't owe you anything
And you don't own me

I will not forget

Don't burden me with all of your problems
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel

Every day's the same
Driving me insane
Just take one step back
I'm getting my life on track

Realizing now
How you break me down
I'm in such a better place
Without you around

I will not forget

Don't burden me with all of your problems
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel

The pain that I feel
The pain that I feel
Tear apart
Oh, tear apart the pain that I feel

I will not forget

Don't burden me with all of your problems
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel

Don't burden me with all of your problems
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel
