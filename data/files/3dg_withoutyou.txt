What if I walk without you
What if I run without you
What if I stand without you
I could not go on

What if I live without you
What if I love without you
What if I died without you
I could not go on

You left my side tonight
And I, I just don't feel right
But I, I can't let you out of sight
Without you, I'm no one, I'm nothing at all

What if I lie without you
What if I rise without you
What if I dream without you
I could not go on

You left my side tonight
And I, I just don't feel right
But I, I can't let you out of sight
Without you, I'm no one, I'm nothing at all

You left my side tonight
I just don't feel right
I can't let you out of sight
Without you, I'm no one, I'm nothing at all

You left my side tonight
And I, I just don't feel right
But I, I can't let you out of sight
Without you, I'm no one, I'm nothing at all

Nothing at all
