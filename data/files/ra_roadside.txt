Tell me what I'm supposed to do
With all these left over feelings of you
'Cause I don't know
And tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When all these nightmares become real
'Cause I don't know

And I don't think you see
The places inside me that I find you
And I don't know how we
Seperate the lies here from the truth
And I don't know how we
Woke up one day somehow thought we knew
Exactly what we're supposed to do

So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry

And I don't think you see
The places inside me that I find you
And I don't know how we
Woke up one day somehow thought we knew
Exactly what were supposed to do

So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry

Cause I don't think you see
The places inside me that I find you
And I don't know how we
Woke up one day somehow thought we knew
Exactly what we're supposed to do
Exactly what to do
