This is all becoming a blur
I thought I'd see it clearer by now I'm not so sure
Everything is coming undone
I thought it would get better, I guess I am someone

Who's stuck in the weeds
Somewhere in between
Contentment and misery

Broken bones, broken words
It's alright that it hurts
When it gets to be
So much, so much
I can't hide from the pain
Beaten down once again
It gets the best of me
So what, so what?
So what, so what?

This is unbecoming of me
It's like my own reflection's not what it used to be
Tryna figure out where I missed
I'll never find the answer, it's just the way it is

Broken bones, broken words
It's alright that it hurts
When it gets to be
So much, so much
I can't hide from the pain
Beaten down once again
It gets the best of me
So what, so what?

I could be right, I could be wrong
But somehow I feel like I'm the only one

Broken bones, broken words
It's alright that it hurts
When it gets to be
So much, so much
I can't hide from the pain
Beaten down once again
It gets the best of me
So what, so what?
So what, so what?
(It gets the best of me
So what, so what?)
So what, so what?
