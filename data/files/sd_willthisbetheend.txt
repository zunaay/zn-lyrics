Do we fight again?
Will this be the end?
There is something wrong
And it's about to take over

Hold me and I'll hold you too
Bite off all that you can chew
Take the air straight out of me
Sorry won't cut it now you see

I thought you said it felt good?
Did our demons come back too soon?
Are we gonna buckle and brake?
Are we just ment to dissipate?

Do we fight again?
Will this be the end?
There is something wrong
And it's about to take over

And if it all ends here
How would that make you feel?
Do we fight again when it's about to take over?

Hurt me and I'll hurt you too
Things aren't like they used to
It seems like the harder we try
Problems just seem to multiply

My weakness is my strong suit
Drown out the fighting with booz
Are we gonna buckle and brake
Are we just ment to dissipate?

Do we fight again?
Will this be the end?
There is something wrong
And it's about to take over

And if it all ends here
How would that make you feel?
Do we fight again when it's about to take over?

(And if it all ends here)
(How would that make you feel?)

Do we fight again?
Will this be the end?
There is something wrong
And it's about to take over

Do we fight again? (Do we fight again?)
Will this be the end?
There is something wrong
And it's about to take over

And if it all ends here
How would that make you feel?
Do we fight again when it's about to take over?

It's about to take over
