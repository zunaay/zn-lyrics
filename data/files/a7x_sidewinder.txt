I slide through the wasteland, that's my world
My hunger takes your life, preyed on to keep me alive, yeah
Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty in me

Can't you feel the poison rising
Out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you
Straight to the heart from the venomous bite

That's right, I shed my skin tonight
But my fangs are hard to hide
And you know that you're going to die, yeah
Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty to me

Can't you feel the poison rising
Out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you
Straight to the heart from the venomous bite

I can't regret, can't escape
Decisions made for me, no control
Fire that burns but never dies, yeah
Wrapped around, I'll bury my fangs inside

Making my way through the night
You're still in my sight
You're runnin' away 
'Cause ya know you can't hide

My instincts are cold-blooded hate
To you I'm the bearer of fate
Wrong place and now the wrong time
Now terror is all that you'll find

Can't you feel the poison rising
Straight to the heart of the venomous bite

Can't you feel the poison rising
Out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you
Straight to the heart from the venomous bite

I can't regret, can't escape
Decisions made for me, no control

Fire that burns but never dies, yeah
Wrapped around, I'll bury my fangs inside

Stay inside tonight
(You're out there all alone)
Vanish from my sites
(Venomous control)
You won't make it right
(My appetite has grown)
Lost your final fight
(No love will be shown)
