Wake me up inside
Tell me there's a reason
To take another step
To get up off our knees and follow
This path of most resistance
Wherever it takes us
Whatever it faces
And wherever it leads

So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel
The things that you do
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream
Wake me up inside

Something for the pain
Just to kill this feeling
Though we look awake
Inside we're all still sleeping
And I spent my time here alive
But barely there
Do you believe we'll ever make it
Do you think we'll ever really say

So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel
The things that you do
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream
Wake me up inside

Wake me up inside
These dreams all die if we let them
Wake me up inside
Today won't start if we just give in

Cause you'll be anything!

Just wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel
The things that you do
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream
Wake me up inside
