Break me, I will always want you
Just need something to hold on to
Wake me if I ever fall asleep
Can you see what will be?
We'll be oversoul, standing over me
I won't know if you're real or just a ghost

Sheltered from the sun
You ask me if I've gone away
I'm taking chances one by one
Until the moment when we find a way
I'll be right here

Reset, just one touch from you was cold sweat
I'd give anything to feel it
In this life or in the next
Letting go
Hold my breath until I feel the pull
I will cross over the space below
Will you be there when I go?

'Cause I'm sheltered from the sun
You ask me if I've gone away
I'm taking chances one by one
Until the moment when we find a way
I'll be right here

I'm falling from the sky
To the edge of nothing
I'm falling from the sky
Is this what you wanted?

Because I'm sheltered from the sun
You ask me if I've gone away
I'm taking chances one by one
Until the moment when we find a way
I'll be right here
