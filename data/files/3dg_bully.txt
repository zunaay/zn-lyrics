He wakes up haunted
With voices in his head
Nobody knows it but today he won't go unnoticed

He can't forget
Can't forgive for what they said
He's never been so hurt
But today the screaming is over

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it all on me
Maybe he needed to be wanted

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Maybe he needed to be wanted

She takes the long way home
Fighting her emotions
She's a loner
But tonight she won't go unnoticed

She can't remember
When she loses her temper
But nobody knows her
But tonight the silence is over

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it all on me
Maybe she needed to be wanted

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it all on me
Maybe she needed to be wanted

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe they needed

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe they needed to be wanted

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe they needed to be wanted

Wanted!
