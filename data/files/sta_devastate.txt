Down in the dark, you live on the bottom
You fooled them all, looks like you got 'em
When all is lost, who will you follow?
When all the same shit will be here tomorrow

You fall for anything
All for nothing
You never cared for anyone at all

Well I hate
Every word that you say
Even when you breathe
I can't stand to see you medicate
Fake
It's all one and the same
Nothing to believe
All you ever do is devastate

Nothing to use, end of the bottle
We fooled 'em all, like a role model
No matter the cost, beg, steal or borrow
'Cause all the same shit will be here tomorrow

You fall for anything
All for nothing
You never cared for anyone at all

Well I hate
Every word that you say
Even when you breathe
I can't stand to see you medicate
Fake
It's all one and the same
Nothing to believe
All you ever do is devastate

All your lies under your disguise
When the weight comes down, you'll be in the ground
All your lies under your disguise
When the weight comes down, you'll be underground
Underground
Underground
Underground

You fall for anything
All for nothing
You never cared for anyone at all

Well I hate
Everything that you say
Even when you breathe
All you ever do is devastate
Well I hate
Every word that you say
Even when you breathe
I can't stand to see you medicate
Fake
It's all one and the same
Nothing to believe
All you ever do is devastate
