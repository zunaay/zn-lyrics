No time for goodbye he said
As he faded away
Don't put your life in someone's hands
Their bound to steal it away
Don't hide your mistakes
'Cause they'll find you, burn you
Then he said

If you want to get out alive
Oh, oh run for your life
If you want to get out alive
Oh, oh run for your life

This is my last time she said
As she faded away
It's hard to imagine
But one day you'll end up like me
Then she said

If you want to get out alive
Oh, oh run for your life
If you want to get out alive
Oh, oh run for your life
If you want to get out alive (if you want to get out alive)
Oh, oh run for your life (life)
If you want to get out alive (if you want to get out alive)
Oh, oh run for your life

If I stay, it won't be long
Till I'm burning on the inside
If I go, I can only hope
That I make it to the other side
If you want to get out alive
Oh, oh run for your life
If you want to get out alive
Oh, oh, run for

If you want to get out alive (if you want to get out alive)
Oh, oh run for your life
If you want to get out alive (if you want to get out alive)
Oh, oh, run for

If I stay, it won't be long
Till I'm burning on the inside
If I go, I can only hope
That I make it to the other side
If I stay, it won't be long
Till I'm burning on the inside
If I go, and if I go

Burning on the inside
Burning on the inside
Burning on the inside
