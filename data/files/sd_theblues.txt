I am quicksand
I am your favorite brand of man
Know how to pick them

I can fix him
Is that your failure of a plan?
Are you my vixen?

Am I the blues
You won't stop singing?

How, haven't you had enough of me?
Are you in the love with the agony?
What you see is what you get
I'm a piece of shit and I honor that

Why do you try to save the day?
All you do is give and all I do is take
And it seems like you forget
That I'm a piece of shit and I honor that

I always find them
Who aren't too sure about themselves
Know how to pick them

It's a sickness
Growing cancer in your head
Of what time just cannot mend

How, haven't you had enough of me?
Are you in the love with the agony?
What you see is what you get
I'm a piece of shit and I honor that

Why do you try to save the day?
All you do is give and all I do is take
And it seems like you forget
That I'm a piece of shit and I honor that

I am the blues, you won't stop singing
I am the blues, you won't stop singing
I am the blues, you won't stop singing
I am the blues, you won't stop singing
I am the blues, you won't stop singing
I am the blues, you won't stop singing

How, haven't you had enough of me?
Are you in the love with the agony?
What you see is what you get
I'm a piece of shit and I honor that

Why do you try to save the day?
All you do is give and all I do is take
And it seems like you forget
That I'm a piece of shit and I honor that
