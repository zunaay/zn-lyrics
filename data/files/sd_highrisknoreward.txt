Lend me your ear
Let me tell you a little secret
Soon we'll all be done
There's no where else to run
What I'm about to say
Might ruin your evening
Starving us one by one
While we're starring at the sun

This is a high risk
No reward motherfucker
This is a high risk
No reward

They're standing on the rooftop
Watching it all
Stuck here on the ground
We are taking the fall
While the world is burning
They get away with murder
Standing of the roof
(Standing of the roof)
Standing of the rooftop

Lend me your eyes
Let me show you a little secret
Behind every suit
There lies the naked truth
What I'm about to show
Might sink a little deeper
When you understand
This is just a scam

This is a high risk
No reward motherfucker
This is a high risk
No reward

They're standing of the rooftop
Watching it all
Stuck here on the ground
We are taking the fall
While the world is burning
They get away with murder
Standing of the roof
(Standing of the roof)
Standing of the rooftop

This is a high risk
No reward motherfucker
This is a high risk
No reward motherfucker
This is a high risk
No reward motherfucker
This is a high risk
No reward motherfucker
Motherfucker
Lend me your ear
Let me tell you a little secret

They're standing on the rooftop
Watching it all
Stuck here on the ground
We are taking the fall
While the world is burning
They get away with murder
Standing of the roof
(Standing of the roof)
Standing of the rooftop

Ooh
They're standing on the rooftop
