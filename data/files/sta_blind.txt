Would you believe me, the things that I say
I'm tired, I'm gone, I'm lost without you
You don't see through me, you can't run away
I'm changing, deranging
The darkness replacing composure
It burns my eyes
As I watch the flame die

I will be satisfied
When I get to the finish line
And take back all that's mine
The fire in me hasn't died
Always trying to put it out
You made it so bright, now you're blind

So easy to see you and me today
A searchlight, we're alright, we're fine without this
Self loathing fear now that stands in our way
I'm fading, degrading
The darkness replacing composure
It burns my eyes
As I watch the flame die

I will be satisfied
When I get to the finish line
And take back all that's mine
The fire in me hasn't died
Always trying to put it out
You made it so bright, now you're blind

My fire burns for the broken ones
The unspoken ones
My fire burns down the battered walls
And the bleeding halls
We find our way to climb
Over the barricades and the masquerades
We light our fire and burn, burn

I will be satisfied
When I get to the finish line
And take back all that's mine
The fire in me hasn't died
(Hasn't died, hasn't died, hasn't died)
(Hasn't died, hasn't died)

I will be satisfied
When I get to the finish line
And take back all that's mine
The fire in me hasn't died
Always trying to put it out
You made it so bright, now you're blind
Now you're blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
