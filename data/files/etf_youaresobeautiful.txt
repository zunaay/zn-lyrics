I could have found a better way
You know I never should have stayed
I could have done the things
That I believed were wrong
(You know you're wrong!)
Now you're saying that it's late
It doesn't matter what I say
You know you're just another one of my mistakes
(yeah!)

You are so beautiful
You are the kind of girl
That has the chemicals
That makes me fall in love
Beautiful, you are the kind of girl
That has the chemicals
That makes me fall in love

So now I'm feeling like a slave
I'm locked away inside this grave
And now I'm hoping for
A way I can be saved (I can be saved!)
You know that there will come a day
When I'm just gonna have to change
You know you're just another one of my mistakes
(yeah!)

You are so beautiful
You are the kind of girl
That has the chemicals
That makes me fall in love
Beautiful, you are the kind of girl
That has the chemicals
That makes me fall in love
Fall in love

You know I found a small paper
You lied about, you lied about
You know I found a small paper
You lied about, you lied about
You lie to me, lie to me

You are so beautiful
You are the kind of girl
That has the chemicals
That makes me fall in love
Difficult, so very difficult
You are the kind of girl
That makes me fall in love
Fall in love
