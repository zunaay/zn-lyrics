Come on put yourself back together
Pick up some pieces of the hearts you've shattered
What have you thrown away this time?
Are you really that out of your mind?

Better pull yourself back together
You could be something
Your once step closer to the throne
King of nothing
Do you see yourself in the mirror?
You should be something
Your once step closer to the throne
King of nothing

When did you decide to start to lie
Or were you born that way
You defend yourself to the bitter end
You push everyone you know away
This time you'll pay when you've got nothing
You got no reason to pretend

Better pull yourself back together
You could be something
Your once step closer to the throne
King of nothing
Do you see yourself in the mirror?
You should be something
Your once step closer to the throne
King of nothing

All the dreams you've been chasing
All the life you've been missing
It's all right here waiting for you
And it's so disappointing
The only one that your hurting
The only heart that your breaking belongs to you

Better pull yourself back together
You could be something
Your once step closer to the throne
King of nothing
Do you see yourself in the mirror?
You should be something
Your once step closer to the throne
King of nothing

Better pull yourself back together
You could be something
Your once step closer to the throne
King of nothing
King of nothing
King of nothing, nothing
