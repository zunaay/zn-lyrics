Another day on a homicide
Another ray through a broken window
No evidence of an alibi
Hiding in the shadows
Looking for some kind of spark
I'm not sure if it really matters
Just a beat in a broken heart
Unhappy ever after

Alive, can't breathe
I run, but can't reach
I look but I can't see

Am I wasting my time?
Do I give up the fight?
Am I losing my grip
When the day feels like night?
Do I let it all go?
Do I keep it inside?
Am I out here alone?
Am I wasting my time chasing the light?

Chasing the light

Looking up at a sky of stars
Looking out for a life worth saving
No evidence of who we are
For who we end up facing

Alive, can't breathe
I run, but can't reach
I look, but I can't see

Am I wasting my time?
Do I give up the fight?
Am I losing my grip when the day feels like night?
Do I let it all go?
Do I keep it inside?
Am I out here alone?
Am I wasting my time chasing the light?

Chasing the hope
I'm chasing the truth in a world that's so cold
Chasing the life that we used to know
I'm chasing what's already out of control

Am I wasting my time?
Do I give up the fight?
Am I losing my grip when the day feels like night?
Do I let it all go?
Do I keep it inside?
Am I out here alone?
Am I wasting my time chasing the light?

Chasing the light

Am I wasting my time?
Do I give up the fight?
Am I losing my grip
When the day feels like night?
Do I let it all go?
Do I keep it inside?
Am I out here alone?
Am I wasting my time chasing the light?
