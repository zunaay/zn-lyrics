Whoa!

Don't believe what they say
We're dead flies in the summertime
They leave us all behind
With duct tape scars on my honey!
They don't like who you are
You won't like where we'll go
Brother protect me now
With blood they wash in the money

You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy
You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy

Uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh
Right now

I'm sick down from the bones to the other side
Red mod, we insects hide
King rat on the street in another life
They laugh, we don't think it's funny
If what you are
Is just what you own
What have you become
When they take from you
Almost everything

You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy
You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy

Destroya destroya destroya destroya destroya destroya
Against the Sun, we're the enemy!
Destroya destroya destroya, destroya

Uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh

I don't believe in God (you don't believe in God)
I don't believe in luck (I don't believe in luck)
I don't believe in you (they don't believe in us)
I just believe in the enemy (but I believe in the enemy)
I don't believe in God (you don't believe in God)
I don't believe in love (I don't believe in luck)
I don't believe in you (they don't believe in us)
I just believe in the enemy (but I believe in the enemy)

Uh uh uh uh uhuh (uh uhuh uh uh uhuh uh)
Uh uh uh uh (uh uh uh uh uhuh uh)
Uh uh uh uh uhuhhh (uh uhuh uh uh uh uhhhh)
Uh uh uh uh uhuh (uh uhuh uh uh uhuh uh)
Uh uh uh uhhh (uh uhuh uh)

You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy
You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy

Destroya destroya destroya destroya destroya destroya
Against the Sun, we're the enemy!
Destroya destroya we're all waiting for ya destroya destroya
Against the Sun, we're the enemy!

So show me what you got (destroya destroya destroya...)
You children of the gun (destroya destroya destroya...)
Don't hide and we don't run (destroya destroya destroya...)
Against the Sun, we're the enemy!

So show me what you got

Against the Sun, we're the enemy!
